# Standards: Pattern Discovery Through RAG

This page explains how **standards** create knowledge compounding in prAxIs OS through automatic pattern discovery via semantic search.

**What you'll understand:**
- How standards enable automatic pattern discovery
- The self-improving mechanism
- RAG indexing and discovery
- The compounding effect over time
- Why AI-authored standards work better

---

## What Are Standards?

**Standards** are reusable patterns documented in markdown files that AI agents discover automatically through semantic search.

**Location:** `.praxis-os/standards/development/[topic].md`

**Access:** `search_standards("pattern")`

**Purpose:** Make project-specific conventions discoverable and automatically applied

---

## The Problem Standards Solve

### Without Standards: Reinvention and Inconsistency

**Scenario: Three AI Agents, Same Project**

**Agent 1 (Week 1):**
- Implements authentication with custom JWT refresh pattern
- Makes architectural decisions about token storage
- Completes the work
- **Learning is lost** ❌

**Agent 2 (Week 3):**
- Needs to implement authorization
- Queries standards, finds only universal patterns
- Makes *different* decisions about token handling
- Creates inconsistency in the codebase ❌

**Agent 3 (Week 5):**
- Debugging auth issues
- Finds two different JWT patterns in code
- Wastes time investigating which is "correct"
- No single source of truth ❌

**Result:** Reinvention, inconsistency, technical debt.

---

### With Standards: Discovery and Consistency

**Same Scenario With Standards**

**Agent 1 (Week 1):**
- Implements authentication with custom JWT refresh pattern
- Human: "We should document this as a standard"
- Agent queries: `search_standards("how to create standards")`
- Creates: `.praxis-os/standards/development/authentication.md`
- **Learning is captured** ✅

**Agent 2 (Week 3):**
- Needs to implement authorization
- Queries: `search_standards("JWT authentication patterns")`
- RAG returns Agent 1's documented standard
- Follows the established pattern automatically
- **Consistency maintained** ✅

**Agent 3 (Week 5):**
- Working on auth features
- Queries standards, finds documented pattern
- Uses authoritative project convention
- **Single source of truth** ✅

**Result:** Consistency, velocity, compound knowledge.

---

## How the Mechanism Works

### 1. AI Queries Heavily (5-10+ Times Per Task)

```
AI starting new task
  ↓
search_standards("how to handle API errors in this project")
  ↓
Discovers: Universal patterns + Project conventions
  ↓
Implements using established patterns
```

**Key:** AI *always* queries before implementing. This is the foundation of the system.

---

### 2. Human Identifies Reusable Patterns

As work progresses, you notice patterns worth documenting:
- "We use this error format consistently"
- "This is our third time handling API pagination this way"
- "This pattern should be our standard"

You say: **"Let's create a standard for this"**

---

### 3. AI Creates the Standard (Following Meta-Standards)

AI doesn't just write the standard—it queries to learn HOW to create good standards:

```python
# Query 1: Structure
search_standards("how to create standards")
# Returns: Required sections, quality criteria

# Query 2: Discoverability  
search_standards("RAG content optimization")
# Returns: Keywords, query hooks, TL;DR patterns

# Query 3: Search patterns
search_standards("query construction patterns")
# Returns: How future queries will find this content
```

Then AI writes the standard with:
- **Purpose**: Why this exists
- **The Problem**: What happens without it
- **The Standard**: Specific, actionable rules
- **Examples**: Real code from your project
- **Anti-patterns**: Common mistakes to avoid
- **Keywords**: Optimized for semantic search

**Why Heavy Querying Matters:**
- Ensures consistent structure across all standards
- Optimizes for discoverability (AI knows how it searches)
- Follows meta-standards (standards about creating standards)
- Creates standards that AI can find

---

### 4. RAG Automatically Indexes

- File watcher detects new `.md` in `standards/development/`
- RAG engine re-indexes within ~5 seconds
- Standard is now discoverable via `search_standards()`
- Semantic embeddings enable natural language queries

**No manual work needed**—just save the file.

---

### 5. Future AI Discovers and Applies

Next time any AI works on related code:
```python
search_standards("API error handling")
# Returns YOUR standard in top 3 results
# AI follows YOUR project's conventions automatically
```

**This happens automatically** on every task, forever.

---

## The Self-Improving Loop

### The Reinforcing Mechanism

```
AI queries before implementing
  ↓
Discovers existing standards
  ↓
Follows consistent patterns
  ↓
Human identifies new pattern worth documenting
  ↓
AI creates standard (using standard-creation standards)
  ↓
RAG indexes new standard
  ↓
Future AI discovers via queries
  ↓
Pattern reinforces and compounds
```

**Each standard makes the next 10 tasks better.**

### Why This Is Self-Reinforcing

1. **Standards teach querying**: Content includes "query before implementing"
2. **Querying finds standards**: AI discovers patterns automatically
3. **Standards reinforce querying**: Each result includes "query liberally"
4. **More queries = more discovery**: AI learns to query comprehensively
5. **Better standards result**: AI creates standards using learned patterns

**The system improves through use.**

**What changed:**
- Every major pattern documented
- Consistent quality across entire codebase
- New features follow established conventions
- Technical debt reduced (patterns followed consistently)
- Knowledge survives team changes

## Why AI-Authored Standards Work Better

When AI creates standards (with human approval):

### 1. AI Understands Search Patterns

AI knows how it will query in the future:
- What keywords to include
- What questions to answer
- What phrases match semantic search

**Result:** Standards optimized for AI discovery.

### 2. AI Follows Meta-Patterns

AI queries standard-creation standards:
- Learns required structure
- Follows RAG optimization guidelines
- Includes all necessary sections

**Result:** Consistent quality across all standards.

### 3. AI Optimizes for Its Own Consumption

AI creates content structured for:
- Semantic search (embeddings)
- Natural language queries
- Contextual relevance

**Result:** High-quality retrieval on every query.

### 4. Queries Ensure Quality

Heavy querying before creation means:
- Standards follow established patterns
- RAG optimization is built-in
- Discovery is tested implicitly

**Result:** Standards that work automatically.

---

## Real-World Example

### Before Standard: Inconsistency

**Task 1** (Week 1):
```python
# AI implements error handling
try:
    response = api.call()
except APIError as e:
    return {"error": str(e)}  # Pattern A
```

**Task 2** (Week 2):
```python
# Different AI, different pattern
try:
    response = api.call()
except APIError as e:
    raise HTTPException(detail=str(e))  # Pattern B
```

**Result:** Inconsistency, no single pattern.

---

### After Creating Standard: Consistency

**Human:** "We should standardize our API error handling. Let's always return structured errors with codes and messages."

**AI Creates Standard:**
1. Queries: `search_standards("how to create standards")`
2. Creates: `.praxis-os/standards/development/api-error-handling.md`

```markdown
# API Error Handling Standard

**Keywords**: API errors, error handling, error responses...

## The Standard
All API errors must return:
- `error_code`: String identifier
- `message`: Human-readable message  
- `details`: Optional structured data

Example:
{
  "error_code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
  "message": "Invalid email format",
  "details": {"field": "email"}
}
...
```

**Task 3** (Week 3):
```python
# New AI queries before implementing
search_standards("API error handling")
# Discovers the standard

# Implements consistently
try:
    response = api.call()
except APIError as e:
    return {
        "error_code": e.code,
        "message": str(e),
        "details": e.context
    }
```

**Result:** Every future API implementation uses the same pattern automatically.

---

## Key Principles

### 1. Discovery Over Memory

AI doesn't "memorize" standards—it **discovers** them on demand:
- Queries before each task
- Gets fresh, relevant context
- Finds exactly what's needed when needed
- Scales to hundreds of standards

**Why this matters:** Memory fades, discovery works at any scale.

### 2. Patterns, Not Implementations

Standards document reusable patterns:
- ✅ "How to handle API errors" (pattern)
- ❌ "User authentication implementation" (implementation)

**Why this matters:** Patterns apply to many situations, implementations don't.

### 3. Project-Specific, Not Universal

Standards capture YOUR conventions:
- ✅ "Our API response format"
- ❌ "REST API best practices" (already in universal standards)

**Why this matters:** Universal patterns are already available—document what's unique to your project.

### 4. Collaborative Creation

**Human decides what to document:**
- Recognizes reusable patterns
- Makes strategic decision to standardize
- Provides context and requirements

**AI does the writing:**
- Queries heavily to learn structure
- Creates RAG-optimized content
- Follows meta-standards for consistency

**Why this matters:** Combines human judgment with AI execution.

## The Long-Term ROI

### Months 1-3: Building the Foundation

You're actively documenting patterns as you discover them. This feels like extra work initially, but you're investing in the future.

**Cost:** 5-10 minutes per standard
**ROI:** Each standard saves 15-30 minutes on future tasks
**Break-even:** After 2-3 uses of the pattern

### Months 4-6: Acceleration Phase

The knowledge base reaches critical mass. AI agents start delivering expert-level work with minimal guidance.

**Effect:** 3-4x velocity improvement on routine tasks
**Reason:** AI automatically follows established patterns

### Months 7-12: Organizational Memory

Your project's conventions, patterns, and decisions are fully codified. New team members (human or AI) ramp up by querying standards.

**Effect:** Onboarding time reduced by 70-80%
**Reason:** Standards provide instant project knowledge

### Year 2+: Compound Returns

Standards inform new standards. Patterns build on patterns. The system maintains consistency automatically across 100+ documented conventions.

**Effect:** Project maintains architectural consistency at scale without constant human oversight
**Reason:** Knowledge density creates automatic quality
