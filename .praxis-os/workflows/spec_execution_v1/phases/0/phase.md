# Phase 0: Spec Analysis & Planning

**Phase Number:** 0  
**Purpose:** Parse specification structure, extract phases/tasks, validate completeness, build execution plan  
**Estimated Time:** 5-10 minutes  
**Total Tasks:** 3

---

## 🎯 Phase Objective

Before beginning implementation, systematically analyze the specification to extract all phases, tasks, dependencies, and validation gates. Query relevant standards and build a comprehensive execution plan.

---

## Tasks in This Phase

### Task 1: Locate and Validate Spec
**File:** [task-1-locate-spec.md](task-1-locate-spec.md)  
**Purpose:** Find spec directory, validate structure, check required files  
**Time:** 2 minutes

### Task 2: Parse Tasks File
**File:** [task-2-parse-tasks.md](task-2-parse-tasks.md)  
**Purpose:** Extract phases, tasks, dependencies, validation gates from tasks.md  
**Time:** 3 minutes

### Task 3: Build Execution Plan
**File:** [task-3-build-plan.md](task-3-build-plan.md)  
**Purpose:** Query standards, review design, prepare for implementation  
**Time:** 5 minutes

## Execution Approach

🛑 EXECUTE-NOW: Complete tasks sequentially

Tasks must be completed in order:
1 → 2 → 3

Each task builds on the previous one's output.

---

## Phase Deliverables

Upon completion, you will have:
- ✅ Validated spec structure
- ✅ Extracted phase and task breakdown
- ✅ Mapped dependencies
- ✅ Queried relevant standards
- ✅ Complete execution plan

---

## Validation Gate

🛑 VALIDATE-GATE: Phase 0 Checkpoint

Before advancing to Phase 1:
- [ ] Spec structure validated ✅/❌
- [ ] All phases extracted from tasks.md ✅/❌
- [ ] All tasks parsed with criteria ✅/❌
- [ ] Dependencies mapped and valid ✅/❌
- [ ] Standards queried via MCP ✅/❌
- [ ] Execution plan complete ✅/❌

## Start Phase 0

🎯 NEXT-MANDATORY: [task-1-locate-spec.md](task-1-locate-spec.md)

Begin with Task 1 to locate and validate the specification directory.
