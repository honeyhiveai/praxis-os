# Task 1: Review for Completeness

**Phase:** 5 (Finalization)  
**Purpose:** Verify all required sections present  
**Estimated Time:** 5 minutes

---

## 🎯 Objective

Review all specification documents to ensure every required section is present and filled out. Identify any missing content that must be added before finalization.

---

## Prerequisites

🛑 EXECUTE-NOW: Phases 1-4 must be completed

- specs.md must exist
- srd.md must exist
- tasks.md must exist
- implementation.md must exist

⚠️ NOTE: README.md does NOT exist yet - it will be created in Task 3 after completeness and consistency reviews.

## Steps

### Step 1: Review specs.md Completeness

Check that specs.md includes all sections:

```markdown
**Required Sections:**
- [ ] Executive Summary ✅/❌
- [ ] Architecture Overview ✅/❌
- [ ] Component Specifications ✅/❌
- [ ] API Specifications ✅/❌
- [ ] Data Models ✅/❌
- [ ] Security Design ✅/❌
- [ ] Performance Requirements ✅/❌

**For each section, verify:**
- [ ] Not empty (no TODOs or placeholders)
- [ ] Contains specific details (not vague)
- [ ] Includes examples where appropriate
```

### Step 2: Review srd.md Completeness

Check that srd.md includes all sections:

```markdown
**Required Sections:**
- [ ] Business Goals ✅/❌
- [ ] User Stories ✅/❌
- [ ] Functional Requirements ✅/❌
- [ ] Non-Functional Requirements ✅/❌
- [ ] Out of Scope ✅/❌

**For each section, verify:**
- [ ] All requirements identified
- [ ] Requirements are specific and testable
- [ ] Priorities assigned
- [ ] No placeholder text
```

### Step 3: Review tasks.md Completeness

Check that tasks.md includes all sections:

```markdown
**Required Sections:**
- [ ] Implementation phases defined ✅/❌
- [ ] Tasks for each phase ✅/❌
- [ ] Action items for each task ✅/❌
- [ ] Acceptance criteria ✅/❌
- [ ] Dependencies mapped ✅/❌
- [ ] Validation gates specified ✅/❌
- [ ] Time estimates provided ✅/❌

**For each task, verify:**
- [ ] Specific and actionable
- [ ] Has acceptance criteria (minimum 2)
- [ ] Estimated time provided
```

### Step 4: Review implementation.md Completeness

Check that implementation.md includes all sections:

```markdown
**Required Sections:**
- [ ] Implementation philosophy ✅/❌
- [ ] Code patterns with examples ✅/❌
- [ ] Testing strategy ✅/❌
- [ ] Deployment guidance ✅/❌
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide ✅/❌

**For each section, verify:**
- [ ] Concrete examples provided
- [ ] Not abstract or generic
- [ ] Actionable for developers
```

### Step 5: Identify Gaps

Create a checklist of missing or incomplete sections:

```markdown
## Completeness Gaps

**specs.md:**
- [ ] {Missing section or detail}

**srd.md:**
- [ ] {Missing section or detail}

**tasks.md:**
- [ ] {Missing section or detail}

**implementation.md:**
- [ ] {Missing section or detail}
```

### Step 6: Fill Gaps

For each identified gap:
1. Return to appropriate phase task
2. Add missing content
3. Re-verify completeness

📊 COUNT-AND-DOCUMENT: Completeness status
- Total sections required: [number]
- Sections complete: [number]
- Sections incomplete: [number]
- Completion percentage: [%]

## Completion Criteria

🛑 VALIDATE-GATE: Task Completion

Before proceeding:
- [ ] All specs.md sections complete ✅/❌
- [ ] All srd.md sections complete ✅/❌
- [ ] All tasks.md sections complete ✅/❌
- [ ] All implementation.md sections complete ✅/❌
- [ ] No TODOs or placeholders remain ✅/❌
- [ ] README.md does NOT exist yet (Task 3 will create it) ✅/❌

🚨 FRAMEWORK-VIOLATION: Incomplete sections

Cannot proceed to consistency review with missing sections. All content must be complete first.

⚠️ REMINDER: README.md is intentionally absent at this stage - it will be created in Task 3.

## Next Task

🎯 NEXT-MANDATORY: [task-2-consistency-review.md](task-2-consistency-review.md)

Continue to review cross-document consistency.
