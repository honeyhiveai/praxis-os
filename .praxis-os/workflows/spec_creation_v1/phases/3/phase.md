# Phase 3: Task Breakdown

**Phase Number:** 3  
**Purpose:** Create implementation task list in tasks.md  
**Estimated Time:** 25-35 minutes  
**Total Tasks:** 5

---

## 🎯 Phase Objective

Create a comprehensive tasks.md file that breaks the technical design into actionable implementation tasks. Define phases, tasks with acceptance criteria, dependencies, time estimates, and validation gates.

Requirements from Phase 1 (srd.md) and design from Phase 2 (specs.md) drive all tasks.

## Tasks in This Phase

### Task 1: Identify Implementation Phases
**File:** [task-1-identify-phases.md](task-1-identify-phases.md)  
**Purpose:** Break implementation into logical phases  
**Time:** 5 minutes

### Task 2: Break Down into Tasks
**File:** [task-2-break-down-tasks.md](task-2-break-down-tasks.md)  
**Purpose:** Define specific tasks for each phase  
**Time:** 10 minutes

### Task 3: Write Acceptance Criteria
**File:** [task-3-acceptance-criteria.md](task-3-acceptance-criteria.md)  
**Purpose:** Add testable criteria to each task  
**Time:** 7 minutes

### Task 4: Map Dependencies
**File:** [task-4-map-dependencies.md](task-4-map-dependencies.md)  
**Purpose:** Identify task and phase dependencies  
**Time:** 5 minutes

### Task 5: Define Validation Gates
**File:** [task-5-validation-gates.md](task-5-validation-gates.md)  
**Purpose:** Add phase-level validation checkpoints  
**Time:** 8 minutes

## Execution Approach

🛑 EXECUTE-NOW: Complete tasks sequentially

Tasks build upon each other: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5

---

## Phase Deliverables

Upon completion, you will have:
- ✅ tasks.md created with complete structure
- ✅ At least 1 implementation phase defined
- ✅ At least 3 tasks per phase
- ✅ All tasks have acceptance criteria
- ✅ Dependencies mapped
- ✅ Validation gates specified

---

## Validation Gate

🛑 VALIDATE-GATE: Phase 3 Checkpoint

Before advancing to Phase 4:
- [ ] tasks.md file exists ✅/❌
- [ ] At least 1 phase defined ✅/❌
- [ ] At least 3 tasks defined ✅/❌
- [ ] All tasks have acceptance criteria ✅/❌
- [ ] Dependencies mapped ✅/❌
- [ ] Validation gates specified ✅/❌
- [ ] Time estimates provided ✅/❌

🚨 FRAMEWORK-VIOLATION: Vague tasks without acceptance criteria

Tasks must be specific and testable. See `core/tasks-template.md` for good vs bad examples.

## Start Phase 3

🎯 NEXT-MANDATORY: [task-1-identify-phases.md](task-1-identify-phases.md)

Begin with Task 1 to identify implementation phases.
