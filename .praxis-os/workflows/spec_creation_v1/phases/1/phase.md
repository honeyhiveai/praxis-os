# Phase 1: Requirements Gathering

**Phase Number:** 1  
**Purpose:** Define comprehensive requirements in srd.md  
**Estimated Time:** 20-30 minutes  
**Total Tasks:** 5

---

## 🎯 Phase Objective

Create a Software Requirements Document (srd.md) that clearly defines what needs to be built, why it's needed, and what success looks like. This phase establishes the foundation for all subsequent design and implementation work.

If Phase 0 was completed, leverage extracted insights to inform requirements.

## Execution Approach

🛑 EXECUTE-NOW: Complete tasks sequentially

Tasks must be completed in order: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5

Each task adds a section to srd.md, building a complete requirements document.

---

## Phase Deliverables

Upon completion, you will have:
- ✅ srd.md created with standard structure
- ✅ At least 1 business goal defined
- ✅ At least 1 user story documented
- ✅ At least 3 functional requirements listed
- ✅ Non-functional requirements specified
- ✅ Out-of-scope boundaries clarified

## Validation Gate

🛑 VALIDATE-GATE: Phase 1 Checkpoint

Before advancing to Phase 2:
- [ ] srd.md file exists ✅/❌
- [ ] At least 1 business goal defined ✅/❌
- [ ] At least 1 user story documented ✅/❌
- [ ] At least 3 functional requirements listed ✅/❌
- [ ] Non-functional requirements addressed ✅/❌
- [ ] Out-of-scope explicitly stated ✅/❌
- [ ] All requirements are specific and measurable ✅/❌
- [ ] Supporting docs referenced (if Phase 0 completed) ✅/❌

🚨 FRAMEWORK-VIOLATION: Vague or unmeasurable requirements

Requirements must be specific, measurable, and testable. Generic statements like "improve performance" or "better UX" are NOT acceptable. Use concrete metrics and criteria.
