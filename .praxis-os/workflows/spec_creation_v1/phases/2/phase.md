# Phase 2: Technical Design

**Phase Number:** 2  
**Purpose:** Define technical architecture and design in specs.md  
**Estimated Time:** 30-45 minutes  
**Total Tasks:** 6

---

## 🎯 Phase Objective

Create a Technical Specifications Document (specs.md) that translates requirements into concrete technical design. This phase defines the architecture, components, interfaces, data models, and quality considerations that guide implementation.

Requirements from Phase 1 (srd.md) drive all design decisions.

---

## Tasks in This Phase

### Task 1: Design Architecture
**File:** [task-1-architecture.md](task-1-architecture.md)  
**Purpose:** Define system architecture with diagrams  
**Time:** 10 minutes

### Task 2: Define Components
**File:** [task-2-components.md](task-2-components.md)  
**Purpose:** Break system into logical components  
**Time:** 8 minutes

### Task 3: Specify APIs
**File:** [task-3-apis.md](task-3-apis.md)  
**Purpose:** Define interfaces and contracts  
**Time:** 8 minutes

### Task 4: Model Data
**File:** [task-4-data-models.md](task-4-data-models.md)  
**Purpose:** Define data structures and schemas  
**Time:** 7 minutes

### Task 5: Address Security
**File:** [task-5-security.md](task-5-security.md)  
**Purpose:** Define security patterns and controls  
**Time:** 7 minutes

### Task 6: Plan Performance
**File:** [task-6-performance.md](task-6-performance.md)  
**Purpose:** Define performance strategies and optimizations  
**Time:** 5 minutes

## Execution Approach

🛑 EXECUTE-NOW: Complete tasks sequentially

Tasks must be completed in order: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6

Each task adds a section to specs.md, building a complete technical design.

---

## Phase Deliverables

Upon completion, you will have:
- ✅ specs.md created with standard structure
- ✅ Architecture documented with diagrams
- ✅ Components defined with responsibilities
- ✅ APIs/interfaces specified
- ✅ Data models designed
- ✅ Security controls defined
- ✅ Performance strategies documented

## Validation Gate

🛑 VALIDATE-GATE: Phase 2 Checkpoint

Before advancing to Phase 3:
- [ ] specs.md file exists ✅/❌
- [ ] Architecture documented with diagrams ✅/❌
- [ ] All components defined with responsibilities ✅/❌
- [ ] APIs/interfaces specified ✅/❌
- [ ] Data models complete ✅/❌
- [ ] Security addressed ✅/❌
- [ ] Performance considerations documented ✅/❌
- [ ] Design traceable to requirements (srd.md) ✅/❌

🚨 FRAMEWORK-VIOLATION: Design without requirements traceability

Every design decision must trace back to a requirement in srd.md. Design that doesn't support specific requirements is over-engineering.

## Start Phase 2

🎯 NEXT-MANDATORY: [task-1-architecture.md](task-1-architecture.md)

Begin with Task 1 to establish the overall system architecture.
