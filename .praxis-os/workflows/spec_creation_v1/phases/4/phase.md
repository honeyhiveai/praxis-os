# Phase 4: Implementation Guidance

**Phase Number:** 4  
**Purpose:** Create implementation guidance in implementation.md  
**Estimated Time:** 20-25 minutes  
**Total Tasks:** 4

---

## 🎯 Phase Objective

Create an implementation.md file that provides code patterns, testing strategies, deployment guidance, and troubleshooting tips. This guides developers through actual implementation with examples and best practices.

Specifications from Phase 2 (specs.md) and tasks from Phase 3 (tasks.md) inform all implementation guidance.

---

## Tasks in This Phase

### Task 1: Document Code Patterns
**File:** [task-1-code-patterns.md](task-1-code-patterns.md)  
**Purpose:** Define coding patterns and anti-patterns  
**Time:** 8 minutes

### Task 2: Define Testing Strategy
**File:** [task-2-testing-strategy.md](task-2-testing-strategy.md)  
**Purpose:** Specify testing approach and examples  
**Time:** 7 minutes

### Task 3: Add Deployment Guidance
**File:** [task-3-deployment.md](task-3-deployment.md)  
**Purpose:** Document deployment steps and rollback  
**Time:** 5 minutes

### Task 4: Provide Troubleshooting Guide
**File:** [task-4-troubleshooting.md](task-4-troubleshooting.md)  
**Purpose:** Common issues and debugging tips  
**Time:** 5 minutes

## Execution Approach

🛑 EXECUTE-NOW: Complete tasks sequentially

Tasks build implementation.md section by section: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4

---

## Phase Deliverables

Upon completion, you will have:
- ✅ implementation.md created
- ✅ Code patterns documented with examples
- ✅ Testing strategy defined
- ✅ Deployment procedures documented
- ✅ Troubleshooting guide provided

---

## Validation Gate

🛑 VALIDATE-GATE: Phase 4 Checkpoint

Before advancing to Phase 5:
- [ ] implementation.md file exists ✅/❌
- [ ] Code patterns documented ✅/❌
- [ ] Testing strategy defined ✅/❌
- [ ] Deployment guidance specified ✅/❌
- [ ] Troubleshooting tips provided ✅/❌
- [ ] Examples are concrete and actionable ✅/❌

🚨 FRAMEWORK-VIOLATION: Generic patterns without examples

Implementation guidance must include concrete code examples, not just abstract descriptions.

## Start Phase 4

🎯 NEXT-MANDATORY: [task-1-code-patterns.md](task-1-code-patterns.md)

Begin with Task 1 to document code patterns.
