# Task 1: Create Workflow Directory

**Phase**: 2 - Workflow Scaffolding  
**Purpose**: Create .praxis-os/workflows/{workflow_type}/  
**Depends On**: Phase 0 (target_workflow_type, workflow_root_path)  
**Feeds Into**: Task 2 (Create Phase Directories)

---

## Objective

Create the root directory for the target workflow in the correct location within the Agent OS structure.

---

## Context

üìä **CONTEXT**: Workflows are stored in `.praxis-os/workflows/`. The workflow type comes from Phase 0 Task 5 preparation.

---

## Instructions

### Step 1: Construct Directory Path

Use the `target_workflow_type` from Phase 0 to construct the full path:

```
.praxis-os/workflows/{target_workflow_type}/
```

Example: If `target_workflow_type` is `payment_processing_v1`:
```
.praxis-os/workflows/payment_processing_v1/
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **CONSTRAINT**: The directory name MUST exactly match the `workflow_type` field from the workflow definition (which uses underscores, not dashes).

### Step 2: Check if Directory Already Exists

Before creating, verify the directory does not already exist.

üìñ **DISCOVER-TOOL**: List directory contents to check existence

If the directory already exists:
- üö® **CRITICAL**: Determine if this is an overwrite scenario
- If not explicitly approved to overwrite, STOP and request guidance
- If approved, document that we're overwriting an existing workflow

### Step 3: Create Directory

Create the directory using the appropriate command.

üìñ **DISCOVER-TOOL**: Create a directory at a specified path

Verify the command succeeded.

### Step 4: Verify Creation

Confirm the directory was created successfully.

üìñ **DISCOVER-TOOL**: List directory contents to verify creation

Expected result: Directory exists and is empty (or only contains hidden files like .DS_Store).

---

## Expected Output

**Variables to Capture**:
- `workflow_directory_path`: String (absolute path to created directory)
- `directory_created`: Boolean (true if creation successful)
- `is_overwrite`: Boolean (true if overwriting existing)

---

## Quality Checks

‚úÖ Directory path correctly constructed  
‚úÖ Checked for existing directory  
‚úÖ Directory created successfully  
‚úÖ Creation verified  
‚úÖ Path stored for subsequent tasks
