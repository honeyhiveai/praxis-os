# Task 5: Implement Refinements

**Phase**: 5 - Testing & Delivery  
**Purpose**: Fix all identified usability issues  
**Depends On**: Task 4 (usability issues identified)  
**Feeds Into**: Task 6 (Create Usage Guide)

---

## Objective

Address all usability issues identified in Task 4, prioritizing critical and high-priority improvements to make the workflow more intuitive and user-friendly.

---

## Context

📊 **CONTEXT**: This task is similar to Phase 3 Task 8 (Fix Violations), but focuses on usability improvements rather than technical compliance. The goal is to enhance user experience.

⚠️ **MUST-READ**: [../../core/usability-review-patterns.md](../../core/usability-review-patterns.md) for improvement strategies and [../../core/file-splitting-strategies.md](../../core/file-splitting-strategies.md) if tasks need splitting

---

## Instructions

### Step 1: Review Usability Issues Report

From Task 4, retrieve prioritized issues:
- Critical (blocking)
- High priority (major friction)
- Medium priority (minor friction)
- Low priority (polish)

Focus on critical and high priority first.

### Step 2: Fix Critical Usability Issues

Use improvement strategies from core/usability-review-patterns.md for each issue type:

**Unclear Instructions**:
- Rewrite steps to be more specific
- Add examples or concrete guidance
- Break complex steps into substeps

**Missing Context**:
- Add 📊 CONTEXT sections with explanations
- Explain the "why" behind the task
- Add 🔍 MUST-SEARCH for deeper knowledge

**Ambiguous Success Criteria**:
- Add clear expected outputs
- Define specific pass/fail conditions
- Add quality checks checklist

**Poor Error Handling**:
- Add specific error scenarios
- Provide corrective actions
- Add 🚨 CRITICAL markers for fatal errors

📖 **DISCOVER-TOOL**: Read and update files

### Step 3: Fix High Priority Issues

Address major friction points:
- Inconsistent terminology → standardize across workflow
- Missing examples → add concrete scenarios
- Verbose instructions → simplify and clarify
- Unclear navigation → improve 🎯 links
- Missing error guidance → add recovery paths

### Step 4: Consider Medium Priority Issues

If time permits, address:
- Improve formatting consistency
- Add helpful context notes
- Enhance examples
- Improve clarity of explanations

### Step 5: Track Refinements Applied

Maintain refinement log (similar to Phase 3 fix log):

```markdown
# Usability Refinements Log

## Critical Fixes
1. [Task X-Y]: [What was fixed]
2. [Phase N overview]: [What was fixed]
...

## High Priority Fixes
[List]

## Medium Priority Fixes
[List if any]

## Total Refinements: {count}
```

### Step 6: Verify No Regressions

After making refinements, spot check:
- File sizes didn't grow excessively (still ≤150 acceptable range)
- Command usage still present
- Navigation still works
- Validation gates unchanged

📖 **DISCOVER-TOOL**: Count lines, verify patterns

If any regressions, address immediately.

### Step 7: Generate Refinements Summary

Create summary with issues addressed (counts by priority), key improvements, files modified, verification status.

---

## Expected Output

**Refinement Log**: refinements_applied count, issues fixed by priority, files modified  
**Verification**: no_regressions, file_sizes_maintained, navigation_intact (all Boolean)  
**Evidence for Task 7**: refinements_applied and usability_improved (both true)

---

## Quality Checks

✅ Usability issues reviewed  
✅ Critical issues fixed  
✅ High priority issues fixed  
✅ Refinement log maintained  
✅ No regressions verified  
✅ Summary generated
