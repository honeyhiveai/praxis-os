# Phase 5: Testing & Delivery

**Purpose**: Test workflow end-to-end, refine, obtain human approval  
**Deliverable**: Tested, refined, production-ready workflow

**Note**: This is Phase "N+5" in the workflow definition, where N = number of target workflow phases.

---

## Overview

This final phase ensures the workflow is ready for production use. We systematically:

1. **Test** workflow navigation works correctly
2. **Validate** all commands are clear and properly formatted
3. **Validate** gates are parseable by CheckpointLoader
4. **Identify** usability issues through review
5. **Implement** refinements based on findings
6. **Create** usage guide for workflow consumers
7. **Re-validate** compliance after refinements
8. **Audit** content quality (detect generic stubs)
9. **Obtain** human approval for production release

**Status**: â¬œ Not Started | ðŸŸ¡ In Progress | âœ… Complete

## Validation Gate

ðŸš¨ **CRITICAL**: Phase 4 MUST complete successfully before workflow is released.

**Evidence Required**:

| Evidence | Type | Validator | Description |
|----------|------|-----------|-------------|
| `dry_run_successful` | boolean | is_true | Dry run completed without errors |
| `usability_issues_count` | integer | greater_than_0 | Number of usability issues found |
| `refinements_applied` | boolean | is_true | All identified issues addressed |
| `usage_guide_created` | boolean | is_true | Usage guide written |
| `final_compliance_passed` | boolean | is_true | Final compliance check passed |
| `content_quality_passed` | boolean | is_true | No generic stubs detected |
| `content_quality_compliance_percent` | integer | percent_gte_95 | Percentage of compliant task files |
| `generic_content_detected` | boolean | is_false | No generic placeholder content found |
| `human_approved` | boolean | is_true | Human reviewed and approved for production |

**Human Approval**: **REQUIRED**
