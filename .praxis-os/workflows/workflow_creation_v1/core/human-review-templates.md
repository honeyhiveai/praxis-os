## Review Guidance for Human Reviewer

### Quick Review (~15 minutes)
1. Read design summary
2. Review phase structure (phase.md files)
3. Sample 5-10 task files
4. Check compliance report highlights
5. Review usage guide introduction

### Thorough Review (~45 minutes)
1. Read complete design summary and usage guide
2. Review all phase overviews
3. Sample 30% of task files
4. Verify validation gates make sense
5. Check command language usage
6. Assess overall coherence and quality

### Deep Review (~2 hours)
1. Read every phase and task file
2. Trace navigation paths
3. Validate all validation gates
4. Check supporting documentation
5. Assess production readiness thoroughly

**Recommendation**: Minimum Quick Review, preferably Thorough

## Decision Handling Procedures

### APPROVED

**Feedback Capture Format**:
```yaml
review:
  decision: APPROVED
  reviewer: {name}
  date: {date}
  comments: |
    {any feedback or notes}
```

**Next Steps**:
1. Create approval.md in supporting-docs/
2. Update metadata.json with approval fields
3. Create CHANGELOG.md
4. Prepare for distribution

---

### APPROVED WITH MINOR CHANGES

**Feedback Capture Format**:
```yaml
review:
  decision: APPROVED_WITH_CHANGES
  reviewer: {name}
  date: {date}
  changes_requested:
    - {change 1}
    - {change 2}
  comments: |
    {additional feedback}
```

**Next Steps**:
1. Document requested changes
2. Implement minor changes
3. Re-present modified sections
4. Obtain final approval
5. Proceed to APPROVED steps

---

### REQUEST REVISIONS

**Feedback Capture Format**:
```yaml
review:
  decision: REVISIONS_REQUESTED
  reviewer: {name}
  date: {date}
  issues:
    - {issue 1}
    - {issue 2}
  comments: |
    {detailed feedback}
```

**Next Steps**:
1. Document all issues to address
2. Return to appropriate phase (likely Phase 4 Task 5)
3. Make revisions
4. Re-run validation (Task 7)
5. Re-present for review (Task 8)

---

### REJECTED

**Feedback Capture Format**:
```yaml
review:
  decision: REJECTED
  reviewer: {name}
  date: {date}
  reasons:
    - {reason 1}
    - {reason 2}
  recommendations: |
    {guidance for rework}
```

**Next Steps**:
1. Document rejection reasons
2. Assess if workflow concept is viable
3. Consider returning to design phase
4. Re-work significantly
