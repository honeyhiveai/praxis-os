# Phase 0: Pre-Flight Checks

**Purpose:** Validate source and target before any modifications  
**Estimated Time:** 30 seconds  
**Total Tasks:** 4

---

## 🎯 Phase Objective

Validate the source repository, target installation, and system prerequisites before beginning the upgrade process. Ensure all conditions are met for a safe upgrade.

---

## Prerequisites

- Source repository path provided in workflow options
- Target `.praxis-os/` directory exists
- No other upgrade workflows in progress

---

## Tasks in This Phase

### Task 1: Validate Source Repository
**File:** [task-1-validate-source.md](task-1-validate-source.md)  
**Purpose:** Verify source repository is valid and clean  
**Time:** 10s

### Task 2: Validate Target Structure
**File:** [task-2-validate-target.md](task-2-validate-target.md)  
**Purpose:** Check target .praxis-os structure is valid  
**Time:** 5s

### Task 3: Check Disk Space
**File:** [task-3-check-disk-space.md](task-3-check-disk-space.md)  
**Purpose:** Ensure sufficient disk space for backup and upgrade  
**Time:** 5s

### Task 4: Check for Concurrent Upgrades
**File:** [task-4-check-concurrent.md](task-4-check-concurrent.md)  
**Purpose:** Prevent concurrent upgrade workflows  
**Time:** 5s

## Execution Approach

🛑 EXECUTE-NOW: Complete tasks sequentially

Tasks must be completed in order: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4

---

## Phase Deliverables

Upon completion, you will have:
- ✅ Source repository validated (clean, correct structure)
- ✅ Target structure verified
- ✅ Sufficient disk space confirmed
- ✅ No concurrent upgrades detected

---

## Validation Gate

🛑 VALIDATE-GATE: Phase 0 Checkpoint

Before advancing to Phase 1:
- [ ] Source validation passed ✅/❌
- [ ] Target structure valid ✅/❌
- [ ] Disk space sufficient ✅/❌
- [ ] No concurrent workflows ✅/❌
