## Document Relationships

### Complementary Coverage
- **ARCHITECTURE** doc provides system-level context and integration patterns
- **DESIGN** doc provides component-level implementation details
- Together they form complete specification from system architecture to code

### Overlap Areas
Both documents cover:
- PersonaLauncher concept and purpose
- Persona file structure (markdown-based)
- Discovery pattern (query-first approach)
- Three-layer architecture principle

**Resolution:** Use ARCHITECTURE for system integration context, DESIGN for implementation details

### Dependencies
```
ARCHITECTURE (System Level)
    ↓ informs
DESIGN (Component Level)
    ↓ guides
IMPLEMENTATION (Code Level)
```

## Key Insights Summary

### Architecture Insights
1. **Config-Driven Design:** Personas as `.md` files enable zero-code extensibility
2. **Single Implementation:** One PersonaLauncher handles all specialists via file loading
3. **Discovery Over Hardcoding:** RAG-based semantic search enables dynamic workflow discovery
4. **Knowledge Compounding:** Specialists document learnings → RAG indexed → future discovery
5. **Local-First:** No deployment infrastructure, Git-based sharing

### Implementation Insights
1. **Quality Improvement:** 60-70% → 85-95% output quality through domain expertise
2. **Agentic Loop:** While loop with LLM + tools makes specialists autonomous
3. **Tool Prioritization:** search_standards() as primary knowledge source
4. **Phase Gate Integration:** Specialists discover and execute workflows systematically
5. **Extensibility:** Users create custom personas without touching framework code

### Technical Decisions
1. **File naming:** Filename (without .md) = persona name
2. **Tool subset:** Specialists get filtered tool list (no invoke_specialist recursion)
3. **Evidence tracking:** Tool usage, artifacts, metrics captured automatically
4. **Safety limits:** Max iterations (50) prevents infinite loops
5. **Cost tracking:** Token usage and API costs calculated per specialist run
