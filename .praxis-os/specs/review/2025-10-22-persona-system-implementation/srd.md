## 2. Business Goals

### Goal 1: Improve AI Output Quality Through Domain Expertise

**Objective:** Increase AI-generated code/design quality from 60-70% baseline to 85-95% through domain-specialized agents with structured workflows.

**Success Metrics:**
- Specialist output quality: 60-70% baseline → 85-95% target
- First-time-right implementations: 40% → 80%

- Increase developer productivity and satisfaction

### Goal 2: Enable Zero-Code Specialist Extensibility

**Objective:** Allow teams to create custom domain specialists without framework code changes, reducing specialist creation time from hours to minutes.

**Success Metrics:**
- Time to add specialist: ~4 hours (code + test + deploy) → <5 minutes (file creation)
- Code changes required: ~200 lines Python → 0 lines (markdown only)
- Deployment overhead: Build + deploy + restart → Instant (file load)
- Custom specialists created: 0 → 10+ per team within 90 days

**Business Impact:**
- Rapid adaptation to project-specific needs
- Non-programmers can create specialists (markdown editing)
- Lower maintenance burden (one implementation)
- Faster team adoption and experimentation

### Goal 3: Create Self-Improving Knowledge System

**Objective:** Build a system that improves over time through specialist-generated documentation, creating compounding knowledge value.

**Success Metrics:**
- Project standards count: 0 → 100+ within 90 days
- Discovery success rate: N/A → 90%+ (query finds relevant pattern)
- Knowledge reuse: 0% → 60%+ (specialists leverage prior learnings)
- Team knowledge retention: 20% (tribal knowledge) → 80% (documented patterns)

**Business Impact:**
- New team members inherit accumulated wisdom
- Knowledge survives turnover (no tribal knowledge loss)
- System quality improves with usage
- Reduced onboarding time

## 3. User Stories

### Story 1: Invoke Domain Specialist for High-Quality Output

**As a** developer using AI assistance (Cursor, Cline, Windsurf)  
**I want to** invoke domain-specific specialist agents for complex tasks  
**So that** I receive higher-quality, production-ready implementations without extensive rework

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I'm working on a database schema design task
- When I request "Use database specialist to design authentication schema"
- Then the main agent invokes the database specialist persona
- And the specialist queries for database design patterns
- And the specialist discovers and executes the schema-design workflow if available
- And the specialist returns a complete, validated schema with migrations
- And the output quality meets 85-95% production-ready standard
- And the specialist documents learnings for future discovery

**Priority:** Critical

### Story 2: Create Custom Specialist Without Code Changes

**As a** development team lead  
**I want to** create project-specific specialist personas  
**So that** my team can leverage domain expertise tailored to our architecture

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I need a caching optimization specialist
- When I create `.praxis-os/personas/caching.md` with specialist definition
- Then the specialist is immediately available without restart
- And I can invoke it via "Use caching specialist to optimize API"
- And it follows the discovery pattern (query → discover → execute → document)
- And it integrates with existing workflows if applicable
- And the total creation time is under 5 minutes

**Priority:** High

### Story 3: Discover and Execute Structured Workflows

**As a** specialist agent  
**I want to** discover relevant workflows through semantic search  
**So that** I can execute structured, phase-gated processes that ensure quality

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I'm a database specialist with a schema design task
- When I query "how to design database schema"
- Then RAG returns mention of "database-schema-design workflow" if exists
- And I can start the workflow with the target file
- And the workflow guides me through all phases systematically
- And I must provide evidence at each phase gate
- And I cannot skip phases or gates
- And the workflow enforces quality criteria before completion

**Priority:** Critical

### Story 4: Document and Share Learnings

**As a** specialist agent completing a task  
**I want to** document patterns and learnings  
**So that** future specialists discover and leverage this knowledge

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I completed an optimization task with measurable results
- When I call `write_standard("project/performance", "api-caching-pattern", content)`
- Then a markdown file is created in `.praxis-os/standards/project/performance/`
- And the file includes context, pattern, evidence, and usage examples
- And the RAG index rebuilds within 10 seconds
- And future queries for "API performance optimization" return this pattern
- And other specialists can discover and apply this pattern

**Priority:** High

### Story 5: Monitor Specialist Performance and Cost

**As a** team administrator  
**I want to** track specialist execution metrics and API costs  
**So that** I can optimize usage and control expenses

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given a specialist executes a task
- When the specialist completes
- Then metrics are returned including: persona name, tools used, artifacts created, iterations, duration, tokens, cost
- And I can review these metrics to understand usage patterns
- And I can identify expensive operations
- And I can set cost alerts or limits if needed

**Priority:** Medium
