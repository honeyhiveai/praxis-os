## Overview

### What This Feature Does

The Persona System implements domain-specific AI specialists (database, API, security, testing, etc.) that execute through a single PersonaLauncher engine. Specialists discover workflows via RAG semantic search, execute phase-gated processes, and document learnings for future discovery—creating a self-improving knowledge system.

### Who It's For

- **Primary Users:** AI agents (Cursor, Cline, Windsurf) needing domain expertise
- **Secondary Users:** Development teams creating custom specialists for project-specific needs
- **Beneficiaries:** Organizations seeking higher-quality AI-generated code and designs

### Success Metrics

- **Quality:** 85-95% specialist output quality (vs 60-70% baseline)
- **Speed:** <5 minutes to add new specialist (vs 4 hours with code)
- **Adoption:** 10+ custom specialists per team within 90 days
- **Knowledge:** 100+ project standards documented within 90 days
- **Discovery:** 90%+ success rate (specialists find relevant patterns)

- **MCPClient:** Wrapper for MCP tool execution from specialists
- **Persona Files:** Markdown configuration files (`.praxis-os/personas/*.md`)

**Architecture Diagram:**
```
Main Agent (Cursor)
    ↓ MCP invoke_specialist
MCP Server
    ├─ PersonaLauncher (loads .md files)
    ├─ LLMClient (Claude/OpenAI)
    └─ MCPClient (tool executor)
        ↓ queries
Knowledge Layer (RAG, Workflows, Standards)
```

### Technology Stack

- **LLMResponse:** Unified LLM response (content, model, tool_calls, usage)
- **PersonaMetadata:** Persona information (name, path, dates, sections)

### APIs

- **invoke_specialist(persona, task, context):** Main entry point for specialist invocation
- **write_standard(category, name, content):** Create knowledge documents for discovery

## Implementation Plan

### Timeline

**Total Estimated Time:** 60 hours human baseline → 6.5 hours prAxIs OS active (9.2x leverage)

**Phases:**
1. **Phase 1 (16h/1.5h active):** Core Infrastructure - PersonaLauncher, LLMClient, MCPClient, agentic loop
2. **Phase 2 (24h/2.5h active):** Tool Integration - MCP tools, security, performance, file system
3. **Phase 3 (12h/1.5h active):** Base Personas - Template + 4 base personas + unit tests
4. **Phase 4 (8h/1h active):** Documentation - Guides, API docs, E2E tests, validation

### Key Milestones

- **Milestone 1:** PersonaLauncher executing specialists with mocked dependencies (Week 1)
- **Milestone 2:** invoke_specialist tool working end-to-end with real LLM (Week 2)
- **Milestone 3:** 4 base personas created and tested (Week 3)
- **Milestone 4:** Documentation complete, ready for dogfooding (Week 4)

### Dependencies

- **MCP Server:** FastMCP framework operational
- **RAG Engine:** search_standards() working with vector index
- **Workflow Engine:** start_workflow() and complete_phase() functional
- **LLM API Access:** Anthropic Claude and/or OpenAI API keys

## Risks and Mitigations

### Risk 1: LLM API costs exceed budget

**Impact:** High  
**Probability:** Medium  
**Mitigation:**
- Track costs per execution (FR-008)
- Set alert thresholds ($1/execution)
- Use cost-efficient models for simple tasks
- Implement message history pruning

### Risk 2: Agentic loop hits max iterations frequently

**Impact:** Medium  
**Probability:** Medium  
**Mitigation:**
- Optimize persona prompts for clarity
- Improve tool descriptions
- Monitor iteration metrics
- Allow configurable max_iterations
- Enhance workflow discovery (better RAG indexing)

### Risk 3: Personas create inconsistent quality outputs

**Impact:** High  
**Probability:** Low  
**Mitigation:**
- Comprehensive persona template
- Quality examples included
- Persona validation tool
- Review process established

### Risk 4: Discovery pattern fails (specialists don't find workflows)

**Impact:** Medium  
**Probability:** Low  
**Mitigation:**
- Optimize RAG indexing
- Teach query patterns explicitly
- Provide query examples
- Monitor discovery success rate

### Risk 5: Security vulnerabilities in command execution

**Impact:** Critical  
**Probability:** Low  
**Mitigation:**
- Comprehensive blocked commands list
- Parameterized execution (no shell)
- Audit logging
- Regular security review
