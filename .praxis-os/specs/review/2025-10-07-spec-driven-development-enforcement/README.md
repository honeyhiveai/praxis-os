# Spec-Driven Development Enforcement

**Date:** 2025-10-07  
**Status:** Draft - Pending Approval  
**Priority:** Critical  
**Estimated Effort:** 1-2 days

---

## Executive Summary

This specification establishes spec-driven development as a **mandatory requirement** in prAxIs OS, with enforcement mechanisms to prevent AI agents from jumping directly to implementation without design approval.

**Core Principle:** Planning Phase → Approved Spec → Implementation Phase

---

## Problem Statement

**Current State:**
- `.cursorrules` states operating model (human orchestrates, AI implements)
- No enforcement mechanism for design-before-code
- AI agents can (and do) skip directly to implementation
- Violation example: Earlier today, AI proposed adding MCP tools without design discussion

**Impact:**
- Architectural decisions made without approval
- Implementation may not match user preferences
- Rework when design is rejected
- Inconsistent development process

---

## Solution Overview

Establish spec-driven development with:

1. **Process Standard** - Document the mandatory planning → spec → implementation flow
2. **Standardized Spec Structure** - All specs use same 5-file interface
3. **Baseline Quality Definition** - Project-specific quality requirements
4. **Enforcement Guidance** - Clear rules for when specs are required

**Key Insight:** The spec IS the approved design. Planning produces it, workflows execute it.

---

## Design Options

### Option A: Standard Only (Documentation)
Create standards documenting the process, rely on AI compliance.

**Pros:** Simple, flexible  
**Cons:** No technical enforcement

### Option B: Standard + Workflow  
Create standards + `create_spec_v1` workflow to guide spec creation.

**Pros:** Structured, consistent specs  
**Cons:** Adds overhead for small changes

### Option C: Standard + MCP Tool (Recommended)
Create standards + optional MCP tool for spec approval tracking.

**Pros:** Auditable, flexible  
**Cons:** Requires tool implementation

## Scope

### In Scope
- `universal/standards/ai-safety/spec-driven-development.md`
- `.praxis-os/standards/baseline-quality.md` (project-specific)
- Update `.cursorrules` to reference standards
- Documentation and examples

### Out of Scope
- Automated enforcement (MCP approval tool) - future enhancement
- Product layer documentation - separate concern
- Changes to existing workflows

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Standard clearly defines when specs are required
- [ ] Standardized 5-file spec structure documented
- [ ] Baseline quality requirements defined for this project
- [ ] `.cursorrules` references spec-driven requirement
- [ ] Examples provided (small and large specs)
- [ ] AI agents query standard before starting work

---

## Deliverables

1. **Standards**
   - `universal/standards/ai-safety/spec-driven-development.md`
   - `.praxis-os/standards/baseline-quality.md`

2. **Documentation**
   - This spec (complete)
   - Example specs (small and large)
   - Updated `.cursorrules`

3. **Validation**
   - Confirm standards are indexed in MCP RAG
   - Test: AI queries standard before implementing
