## Phase 1: Standards Creation

**Objective:** Create the core standard documents

**Estimated Duration:** 2-3 hours

### Phase 1 Tasks

- [ ] **Task 1.1**: Create `universal/standards/ai-safety/spec-driven-development.md`
  - Write core principle section
  - Document process flow (planning → spec → approval → implementation)
  - Define when spec is required (decision tree)
  - Document 5-file spec structure
  - Explain content depth vs structure
  - Add behavioral triggers for AI
  - Include examples (reference existing specs)
  - Add related standards links
  
  **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - [ ] Standard is complete and comprehensive
  - [ ] Includes clear decision tree for when spec required
  - [ ] Documents all 5 required files
  - [ ] Explains content scaling (small vs large specs)
  - [ ] Provides behavioral triggers for AI queries
  - [ ] References existing specs as examples

- [ ] **Task 1.2**: Create `.praxis-os/standards/baseline-quality.md`
  - Define testing requirements (pytest, tox, coverage >85%)
  - Define documentation requirements (docstrings, README, examples)
  - Define code quality requirements (linting, type hints, Path objects)
  - Define bug fix process (reproduce, test, document)
  - Add review checklist
  - Add tool-specific standards (Python, MCP, workflows)
  - Define exemption process
  
  **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - [ ] All requirements are specific and measurable
  - [ ] Requirements align with existing project practices
  - [ ] Review checklist is comprehensive
  - [ ] Exemption process is defined
  - [ ] Document is project-specific (not generic)

## Phase 2: Integration

**Objective:** Integrate standards with existing systems

**Estimated Duration:** 1 hour

### Phase 2 Tasks

- [ ] **Task 2.1**: Update `.cursorrules` with spec-driven trigger
  - Add new trigger: "About to write ANY code? → Query MCP: 'spec-driven development'"
  - Renumber subsequent triggers
  - Keep all existing triggers intact (additive change)
  - Update comment to clarify two-phase check
  
  **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - [ ] New trigger added as item #3
  - [ ] Existing triggers preserved
  - [ ] No breaking changes to `.cursorrules`
  - [ ] Comment explains spec check + quality check

- [ ] **Task 2.2**: Verify MCP RAG indexing
  - Confirm standards are in indexed paths
  - Test query: "spec-driven development"
  - Test query: "baseline quality"
  - Verify response contains correct standard content
  - Check response time (<100ms)
  
  **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - [ ] MCP RAG finds `spec-driven-development.md`
  - [ ] MCP RAG finds `baseline-quality.md`
  - [ ] Response includes relevant content
  - [ ] Response time is acceptable

## Phase 3: Validation

**Objective:** Validate AI behavior changes

**Estimated Duration:** 1-2 hours

### Phase 3 Tasks

- [ ] **Task 3.1**: Test AI queries standard before coding
  - Start fresh conversation (clear context)
  - Request a feature (e.g., "Add logging to MCP tools")
  - Observe: Does AI query "spec-driven development" standard?
  - Observe: Does AI create spec before implementing?
  - Observe: Does AI seek approval before implementing?
  
  **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - [ ] AI queries standard before starting work
  - [ ] AI creates spec structure (5 files)
  - [ ] AI explicitly asks for approval
  - [ ] AI does NOT start implementation without approval

- [ ] **Task 3.2**: Test AI checks baseline quality
  - Approve a test spec
  - Let AI implement
  - Observe: Does AI query "baseline quality" before completing?
  - Observe: Does AI verify tests, docs, linting?
  - Observe: Does AI update tasks.md?
  
  **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - [ ] AI queries baseline quality standard
  - [ ] AI runs tests and verifies passing
  - [ ] AI checks linting is clean
  - [ ] AI confirms docs are updated
  - [ ] AI updates tasks.md with completion status

- [ ] **Task 3.3**: Test trivial change exemption
  - Request trivial change (e.g., "Fix typo in README")
  - Observe: Does AI correctly identify as trivial?
  - Observe: Does AI proceed without creating spec?
  - Confirm: AI still maintains quality (linting, etc.)
  
  **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - [ ] AI recognizes trivial changes
  - [ ] AI proceeds without spec for trivial changes
  - [ ] AI still maintains code quality
  - [ ] AI does not over-apply spec requirement

## Phase 4: Documentation and Finalization

**Objective:** Document the new process and finalize implementation

**Estimated Duration:** 1 hour

### Phase 4 Tasks

- [ ] **Task 4.1**: Update project documentation
  - Update CONTRIBUTING.md with spec-driven process
  - Add "How to Request Features" section
  - Reference standard in development workflow
  - Link to example specs
  
  **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - [ ] CONTRIBUTING.md explains spec-driven process
  - [ ] Links to standards are included
  - [ ] Examples provided for clarity
  - [ ] Process is clear to new contributors

- [ ] **Task 4.2**: Create completion summary
  - Document in this spec's README
  - List all files created/modified
  - Confirm all acceptance criteria met
  - Note any lessons learned or future improvements
  - Mark spec status as "Complete"
  
  **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - [ ] Completion summary added to README
  - [ ] All acceptance criteria checked
  - [ ] Files created/modified listed
  - [ ] Spec status updated to "Complete"

- [ ] **Task 4.3**: Update this spec's tasks.md

  **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - [ ] All tasks marked complete
  - [ ] Completion summary comprehensive

## Dependencies

### Phase 1 → Phase 2
Phase 2 (Integration) depends on Phase 1 (Standards) being complete.
Cannot update `.cursorrules` or test MCP queries without standards existing.

### Phase 2 → Phase 3
Phase 3 (Validation) depends on Phase 2 (Integration) being complete.
Cannot validate AI behavior without `.cursorrules` trigger and MCP indexing.

### Phase 3 → Phase 4
Phase 4 (Documentation) depends on Phase 3 (Validation) being successful.
Cannot document process until we confirm it works as expected.

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk: AI ignores new trigger
**Mitigation:** Make standard highly queryable, reference in multiple places

### Risk: Standard too prescriptive (slows down work)
**Mitigation:** Define clear trivial change exemption, err on side of flexibility

### Risk: MCP RAG doesn't index standards
**Mitigation:** Verify indexing in Phase 2, adjust paths if needed

### Risk: Baseline quality too strict for this project
**Mitigation:** Keep project-specific, adjust based on validation feedback

---

## Testing Strategy

### Phase 1 Testing
- **Manual review:** Human reviews both standards for clarity and completeness
- **No automated tests:** Standards are documentation

### Phase 2 Testing
- **MCP query tests:** Verify standards are queryable and return correct content
- **Response time tests:** Confirm queries are fast (<100ms)

### Phase 3 Testing
- **Behavioral tests:** Observe AI behavior in real scenarios
- **Multiple test cases:** Feature request, bug fix, trivial change
- **Fresh context tests:** Start new conversations to ensure clean behavioral testing

### Phase 4 Testing
- **Documentation review:** Confirm documentation is clear and complete
- **Link validation:** Ensure all links work
- **Final smoke test:** One more behavioral test to confirm everything works

---

## Acceptance Criteria Summary

### Standards Quality
- [ ] `spec-driven-development.md` is comprehensive and clear
- [ ] `baseline-quality.md` is project-specific and measurable
- [ ] Both standards are AI-queryable via MCP RAG

### Integration Success
- [ ] `.cursorrules` updated with new trigger
- [ ] MCP RAG indexes both standards
- [ ] Query response time <100ms

### Behavioral Validation
- [ ] AI queries standard before writing code
- [ ] AI creates spec for non-trivial changes
- [ ] AI seeks approval before implementing
- [ ] AI checks baseline quality before completing
- [ ] AI correctly identifies trivial changes

### Documentation Complete
- [ ] CONTRIBUTING.md updated
- [ ] Examples provided
- [ ] Completion summary written
- [ ] All tasks marked complete

---

## Notes

- This is a **behavioral change**, not a code change
- No modifications to Python code (workflow engine, MCP tools, etc.)
- Only markdown files and `.cursorrules` updated
- Rollback is simple: remove `.cursorrules` trigger
- Success depends on AI following standards, not technical enforcement

---

## Future Enhancements (Out of Scope)

- [ ] `create_spec_v1` workflow to guide spec creation
- [ ] MCP tool for programmatic spec approval tracking
- [ ] Spec linting/validation tool
- [ ] Spec template generator script
- [ ] CI/CD integration for spec validation
- [ ] Spec metrics dashboard

---

**Status:** Draft - Awaiting Approval  
**Next Step:** Human review and approval of this spec before implementation begins
