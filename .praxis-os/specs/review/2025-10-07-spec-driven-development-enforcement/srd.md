# Software Requirements Document

**Project:** Spec-Driven Development Enforcement  
**Date:** 2025-10-07

---

## 1. Introduction

This document defines the requirements for establishing spec-driven development as a mandatory practice in prAxIs OS.

### 1.1 Purpose

Formalize the process by which AI agents:
1. Receive change requests
2. Create design artifacts (specs)
3. Obtain approval
4. Implement approved designs

### 1.2 Scope

This requirement applies to:
- All feature additions
- All architectural changes
- All bug fixes requiring design decisions
- All process/standard changes

### 1.3 Definitions

- **Spec**: A design artifact following the 5-file standard structure
- **Planning Phase**: Design discussion between human and AI, produces spec
- **Implementation Phase**: Execution of approved spec using workflows
- **Baseline Quality**: Project-specific mandatory requirements for all implementations

---

## 2. Stakeholder Requirements

### 2.1 Human Orchestrator (Josh)
- **MUST** review and approve designs before implementation
- **MUST** be able to understand scope without reading code
- **SHOULD** have standardized spec interface (same structure every time)

### 2.2 AI Agent (Claude)
- **MUST NOT** write or modify code without approved design
- **MUST** create spec before implementation
- **MUST** query standards for guidance on process
- **SHOULD** use workflows to implement approved specs

### 2.3 Project (prAxIs OS)
- **MUST** maintain consistent development process
- **MUST** have auditable design decisions
- **SHOULD** integrate with existing MCP/workflow infrastructure

---

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Spec Structure Standard

**FR-1:** All specs **MUST** include these 5 files:
1. `README.md` - Executive summary, status, approval
2. `srd.md` - Requirements document
3. `specs.md` - Technical design and architecture
4. `implementation.md` - Implementation patterns and approach
5. `tasks.md` - Breakdown of work with acceptance criteria

**FR-2:** Content depth varies by scope, file structure does not.

### 3.2 Spec-Driven Process

**FR-3:** AI **MUST** follow this flow:
```
User Request → Planning Phase → Create Spec → Seek Approval → Implementation Phase
```

**FR-4:** AI **MUST** query `spec-driven-development` standard when uncertain about process.

**FR-5:** Small changes (typos, formatting) **MAY** skip spec if no design decisions required.

### 3.3 Baseline Quality Requirements

**FR-6:** Project **MUST** define baseline quality in `.praxis-os/standards/baseline-quality.md`.

**FR-7:** Baseline quality **MUST** apply to ALL implementations, regardless of scope.

**FR-8:** Baseline quality **SHOULD** include (at minimum):
- Testing requirements
- Documentation requirements
- Code quality standards
- Bug fix process

### 3.4 Enforcement Guidance

**FR-9:** Standard **MUST** define change categories:
- **Trivial:** No spec needed (typos, formatting)
- **Standard:** Spec required (features, bug fixes)
- **System:** Full spec required (architecture, redesigns)

**FR-10:** AI **MUST** err on the side of creating a spec when uncertain.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Usability

**NFR-1:** Standard **MUST** be queryable via MCP RAG  
**NFR-2:** Spec structure **MUST** be consistent across all specs  
**NFR-3:** Process **SHOULD** not add significant overhead for legitimate work

### 4.2 Maintainability

**NFR-4:** Standard **MUST** be version-controlled  
**NFR-5:** Baseline quality **MUST** be project-specific (not universal)

### 4.3 Alignment

**NFR-6:** Standard **MUST** align with Builder Methods prAxIs OS philosophy  
**NFR-7:** Standard **MUST** support existing workflow infrastructure

---

## 5. Constraints

### 5.1 Technical Constraints
- Must work with existing MCP RAG infrastructure
- Must integrate with `.cursorrules` behavioral triggers
- No new dependencies required

### 5.2 Process Constraints
- Cannot slow down legitimate work
- Must support both small and large changes
- Must be learnable by AI in single query

---

## 6. Acceptance Criteria

### 6.1 Standard Completeness
- [ ] Spec-driven process clearly documented
- [ ] 5-file spec structure defined with examples
- [ ] Change categories defined (trivial, standard, system)
- [ ] Baseline quality concept explained

### 6.2 Project Configuration
- [ ] Baseline quality defined for prAxIs OS project
- [ ] `.cursorrules` references spec-driven requirement
- [ ] MCP RAG can find and return standard

### 6.3 Validation
- [ ] AI queries standard before starting work
- [ ] AI creates spec when required
- [ ] AI does NOT jump to implementation without approval

---

## 7. Dependencies

- **MCP RAG Infrastructure** - For querying standards
- **Workflow Engine** - For executing approved specs (optional but recommended)
- **Git** - For version controlling specs

---

## 8. Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| AI ignores standard | High | Medium | Make it queryable, reference in `.cursorrules` |
| Too much overhead | Medium | Low | Define clear exemptions for trivial changes |
| Baseline quality too strict | Medium | Low | Keep project-specific, start with recommendations |
| Standard not found | High | Low | Ensure MCP RAG indexing works |

---

## 9. Future Enhancements

- **Spec Approval Tracking MCP Tool** - Record approvals programmatically
- **Spec Creation Workflow** - Guide AI through creating specs
- **Spec Template Generator** - Auto-create 5-file structure
- **Spec Linting** - Validate spec completeness
