## Dependencies

### Phase 1 â†’ Phase 2
Phase 2 (Safe Upgrade Tool) depends on Phase 1 (Manifest Generator) being complete.
Cannot test upgrade tool without a manifest.

### Phase 2 â†’ Phase 3
Phase 3 (Interactive Features) depends on Phase 2 (Core Logic) working.
Core classification must work before adding user interaction.

### Phase 3 â†’ Phase 4
Phase 4 (Testing) depends on Phase 3 (Complete Tool) being functional.
Cannot dogfood without complete, working tool.

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk: Checksum mismatch on identical files
**Mitigation:** Ensure both tools use same checksum algorithm (SHA-256, same chunk size)

### Risk: User accidentally overwrites custom work
**Mitigation:** Multiple prompts, show diffs, create backups, require confirmation

### Risk: Partial upgrade leaves system broken
**Mitigation:** Atomic operations where possible, clear rollback instructions, backup before changes

### Risk: Large files slow down upgrade
**Mitigation:** Optimize checksum calculation (chunked reading), test performance

### Risk: Git integration fails in some environments
**Mitigation:** Graceful fallback to filesystem dates, clear error messages

---

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Manifest generator: `tests/unit/test_manifest_generator.py`
- Safe upgrade tool: `tests/unit/test_safe_upgrade.py`
- Target: >90% code coverage

### Integration Tests
- Dogfooding on python-sdk (dry-run then execute)
- Self-upgrade on praxis-os
- Rollback procedure test

### Manual Tests
- User prompts (conflict resolution)
- Diff viewer
- Error messages
- Progress indicators

---

- [ ] CI/CD integration for auto-generating manifest
- [ ] Three-way merge for structured files (JSON, YAML)
- [ ] MCP tool for programmatic upgrades
- [ ] Web UI for diff viewing and conflict resolution
