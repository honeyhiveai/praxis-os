## 2. User Stories

### US-1: Safe Upgrade with Automatic Rollback

**As a** developer using prAxIs OS in my project  
**I want** to upgrade prAxIs OS with a single command and automatic rollback if something fails  
**So that** I can stay current without fear of breaking my development environment

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. ✅ Single command initiates upgrade process
2. ✅ Pre-flight checks validate source and target before any changes
3. ✅ Automatic backup created before any modifications
4. ✅ If any phase fails, automatic rollback to backup
5. ✅ Rollback completes in < 30 seconds
6. ✅ All user customizations preserved (config, custom files)
7. ✅ Clear messaging at each step showing progress
8. ✅ Final report shows what was upgraded

**Priority:** P0 (Must Have)

---

### US-2: Resume Upgrade After Server Restart

**As a** developer upgrading prAxIs OS  
**I want** the upgrade workflow to survive the MCP server restart  
**So that** the workflow can upgrade the server itself without manual intervention

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. ✅ Workflow state persists to disk (`.praxis-os/.cache/state/`)
2. ✅ State includes current phase, completed phases, and artifacts
3. ✅ After server restart, workflow can be resumed with session ID
4. ✅ Resume picks up at Phase 4 (post-restart validation)
5. ✅ All previous phase artifacts available to subsequent phases
6. ✅ No data loss during restart

**Priority:** P0 (Must Have)

---

### US-3: Preview Changes Before Applying

**As a** developer cautious about upgrades  
**I want** to see what will change before committing to the upgrade  
**So that** I can review impacts and decide whether to proceed

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. ✅ Dry-run mode available via configuration option
2. ✅ Preview shows: new files, updated files, conflicts
3. ✅ File-level diff available for key changes
4. ✅ Clear indication of any potential conflicts
5. ✅ Can proceed with actual upgrade after reviewing preview
6. ✅ Preview completes in < 30 seconds

**Priority:** P1 (Should Have)

---

### US-4: Resolve Conflicts Interactively

**As a** developer with custom modifications  
**I want** to be prompted when conflicts are detected  
**So that** I can choose how to resolve them without losing my changes

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. ✅ Conflict detection during content upgrade (Phase 2)
2. ✅ AI prompts for each conflict with context
3. ✅ Options: keep local, use remote, merge, skip
4. ✅ Can review file content before deciding
5. ✅ All decisions logged in upgrade report
6. ✅ Can abort upgrade if conflicts are too complex

**Priority:** P1 (Should Have)

## 5. Workflow Structure

### Phase Overview

The upgrade workflow consists of 6 phases:

| Phase | Name | Duration | Critical Actions |
|-------|------|----------|-----------------|
| 0 | Pre-Flight Checks | ~30s | Validate source, target, disk space |
| 1 | Backup & Preparation | ~20s | Create backup, acquire lock |
| 2 | Content Upgrade | ~45s | Run safe-upgrade.py, handle conflicts |
| 3 | MCP Server Upgrade | ~60s | Copy code, install deps, **restart server** |
| 4 | Post-Upgrade Validation | ~30s | Smoke tests, tool checks |
| 5 | Cleanup & Documentation | ~15s | Release lock, archive backups, reports |

**Total Duration:** ~3 minutes 20 seconds

**Critical Path:** Phase 3 (server restart) → requires state persistence

## 8. Out of Scope

### Explicitly Out of Scope (v1.0)

| Item | Rationale | Future Consideration |
|------|-----------|---------------------|
| Partial upgrades (content-only or MCP-only) | Increases complexity, risk of version mismatch | Consider for v1.1 |
| Multi-project batch upgrades | Single project is MVP | Consider for v2.0 |
| Auto-update on schedule (cron) | Requires additional testing infrastructure | Consider for v2.0 |
| Cloud backup integration | Adds external dependency | Consider for v2.0 |
| Custom MCP server modification detection | Complex three-way merge required | Consider for v1.1 |
| Canary deployments | Requires multiple environments | Consider for v2.0 |
| Delta upgrades (only changed files) | Complexity vs. benefit not justified yet | Consider for v1.1 if performance issue |
| Automatic git commit of upgrades | User repo modification requires permission | Make optional in v1.1 |
| Migration for breaking changes | Handle manually in v1.0 | Build framework in v1.1 |
| Full unit test suite during validation | Too slow (>1 minute) | Make optional in v1.0 |

---

### Assumptions

1. User has `praxis-os` repository cloned locally
2. Source repository is on `main` branch (or specified branch)
3. Python 3.8+ and pip are available
4. Sufficient disk space (2x current `.praxis-os` size)
5. User has write permissions to `.praxis-os/` directory
6. Network access for pip installs
7. MCP server can be restarted without breaking other processes

---

### Constraints

1. Must use existing `safe-upgrade.py` (no re-implementation)
2. Must follow meta-workflow three-tier architecture
3. Must persist state to disk (no database dependency)
4. Phase files must be ≤ 200 lines
5. Task files must be 100-170 lines
6. Must work with copy-based installation (not symlink)
7. Must handle MCP server restart within workflow

---

## 9. Success Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

| Metric | Baseline | Target | Timeline |
|--------|----------|--------|----------|
| Manual upgrade time | ~10 min | < 2 min | Immediate |
| Upgrade-related support tickets | ~5/week | < 1/week | 30 days |
| Users on latest version | ~40% | > 80% | 60 days |
| Failed upgrade rate | Unknown | < 5% | 30 days |
| Rollback usage rate | N/A | < 10% | 30 days |
| User satisfaction (NPS) | Unknown | > 50 | 60 days |

---

### Validation Checkpoints

Each phase has explicit validation gates (see Phase Design in supporting docs):

- **Phase 0:** Source valid, target valid, disk space, no lock
- **Phase 1:** Backup created, integrity verified, lock acquired
- **Phase 2:** Content upgraded, conflicts resolved, version updated
- **Phase 3:** Server copied, deps installed, server restarted, health check passed
- **Phase 4:** Tools registered, smoke tests passed, no errors
- **Phase 5:** Lock released, backups archived, reports generated

---

## 10. Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| State corruption during server restart | Low | High | Atomic writes, backup state file |
| Dependency install failure | Medium | High | Rollback automatically |
| Server fails to restart | Low | High | Health check, automatic rollback |
| Disk space exhausted mid-upgrade | Low | High | Pre-flight disk check |
| User customizations overwritten | Low | Critical | Use safe-upgrade.py, never force overwrite |
| Concurrent upgrade attempts | Medium | Medium | Lock file prevents concurrent runs |
| Network failure during pip install | Medium | Medium | Retry logic, fallback to rollback |
| Playwright install fails (large download) | Medium | Low | Post-install step, can retry manually |
