## Conflicts & Considerations

**No conflicts detected.**

**High Priority Items:**
1. State persistence across MCP server restart (critical innovation)
2. Rollback capability for failed upgrades
3. Validation gates at each phase
4. Safe handling of user customizations

## Next Steps

This index serves as the foundation for Task 3 (Extract Insights), where structured insights will be extracted to inform:
- Phase 1: Requirements gathering (srd.md creation)
- Phase 2: Core design (spec.md creation)
- Phase 3: Task breakdown (tasks.md creation)
- Phase 4: Component design
- Phase 5: Workflow structure finalization
