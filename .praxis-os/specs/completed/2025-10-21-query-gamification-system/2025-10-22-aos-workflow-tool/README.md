# Specification: pos_workflow Consolidated Tool

**Status:** 🟡 In Review  
**Created:** 2025-10-22  
**Target Release:** v1.0  
**Estimated Effort:** 2 weeks (14 days)

---

## Executive Summary

This specification defines the consolidation of 17+ fragmented workflow management tools into a single, powerful `pos_workflow` tool, following the proven `pos_browser` pattern. This consolidation will dramatically improve AI agent performance, reduce cognitive load, and enhance maintainability.

**Problem:** Agent OS currently has ~24 MCP tools, with 17+ dedicated to workflow operations. This high tool count degrades LLM performance by 85% and creates a fragmented, inconsistent interface.

**Solution:** Consolidate all workflow operations into a single `pos_workflow` tool with 14 actions, reducing total tool count from ~24 to ~6 (optimal range for LLM performance).

**Impact:** 
- **Performance:** Reduce tool count by ~75% (24 → 6 tools)
- **Consistency:** Single interface following pos_browser pattern
- **Maintainability:** One codebase vs 17+ scattered tools
- **Discoverability:** Built-in workflow discovery (`list_workflows` action)

---

## Key Features

### 1. Consolidated Action-Based Interface
Single tool with 14 actions organized by category:
- **Discovery (1 action):** list_workflows
- **Execution (5 actions):** start, get_phase, get_task, complete_phase, get_state
- **Management (5 actions):** list_sessions, get_session, delete_session, pause, resume
- **Recovery (3 actions):** retry_phase, rollback, get_errors

### 2. Workflow Discovery
AI agents can dynamically discover available workflows without hardcoding:
```python
# Discover workflows
workflows = pos_workflow(action="list_workflows")
# Returns: test_generation_v3, spec_creation_v1, etc.

# Filter by category
code_gen_workflows = pos_workflow(action="list_workflows", category="code_generation")
```

### 3. Clean Cutover Strategy
No deprecation period or compatibility wrappers:
- Remove old tools immediately
- Deploy new consolidated tool
- Clear, simple interface

### 4. Zero Workflow Engine Modifications
Delegates to existing `WorkflowEngine` and `StateManager` - no changes to core workflow logic required.

---

## Business Value

### Improved AI Agent Performance
- **Current:** 24 tools = 85% performance degradation
- **Target:** 6 tools = 95% performance (optimal range)
- **Result:** Faster, more accurate AI responses

### Simplified Maintenance
- **Before:** 17+ separate tool files to maintain
- **After:** 1 consolidated file with clear organization
- **Result:** Easier to debug, test, and extend

### Enhanced User Experience
- **Discovery:** Agents can find workflows dynamically
- **Consistency:** Same pattern as pos_browser (familiar)
- **Error Messages:** Clear remediation guidance
- **Result:** Better usability for AI agents

### Cost Reduction
- **Fewer Tools:** Reduced context size for LLM
- **Better Performance:** Faster execution = lower costs
- **Easier Maintenance:** Less developer time spent on workflow tools

---

## Technical Highlights

### Architecture
- **Pattern:** Action-based dispatch (like pos_browser)
- **Implementation:** Single `pos_workflow()` function with `action` parameter
- **Dependencies:** Delegates to existing WorkflowEngine and StateManager
- **State Management:** File-based JSON persistence in `.praxis-os/state/workflows/`

### Security
- **Input Validation:** Path traversal protection, session ID validation
- **Resource Limits:** 10MB evidence size limit, 100 concurrent sessions max
- **Error Sanitization:** No sensitive information exposed
- **File Locking:** Concurrency-safe state updates

### Performance
- **Discovery:** < 100ms (cached metadata)
- **Execution:** < 500ms (start, complete_phase)
- **Memory:** < 50MB for active sessions
- **Scalability:** 100+ concurrent sessions supported

### Testing
- **Unit Tests:** >= 85 tests, >= 90% coverage
- **Security Tests:** Path traversal, resource limits, concurrency
- **Performance Tests:** Response times, memory usage, scalability
- **Integration Tests:** End-to-end workflow execution
