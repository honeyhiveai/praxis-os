## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document defines the requirements for consolidating 17+ separate workflow management tools into a single unified `aos_workflow` tool with action-based dispatch, following the proven pattern established by `aos_browser`.

### 1.2 Scope
This feature will replace the current fragmented workflow tool surface (8+ separate MCP tools) with a single consolidated tool that handles all workflow operations through an action parameter, dramatically reducing tool count while maintaining full functionality and improving AI agent performance.

---

## 2. Business Goals

### Goal 1: Optimize AI Agent Performance Through Tool Count Reduction

**Objective:** Reduce total MCP tool count from 24 tools to 5 tools (79% reduction) to achieve optimal LLM performance.

**Success Metrics:**
- Total tools: 24 → 5 (79% reduction)
- Workflow-specific tools: 8 → 1 (87% reduction)
- LLM accuracy: ~85% → ~95% (10% improvement)
- Context pollution: High → Minimal

**Business Impact:**
- AI agents can maintain higher accuracy rates due to reduced tool selection complexity
- Reduced token usage in system prompts (fewer tools to describe)
- Faster agent response times due to simpler tool selection
- Improved reliability and consistency in agent behavior
- Industry-leading tool surface efficiency (5 tools vs typical 15-30 tools)

### Goal 2: Establish Consistent Design Pattern for Complex Domains

**Objective:** Apply the proven `aos_browser` consolidation pattern to workflow management, creating a reusable architectural pattern for future complex domains.

**Success Metrics:**
- Pattern consistency: `aos_browser` (20+ actions, 1 tool) → `aos_workflow` (18 actions, 1 tool)
- Pattern documentation: 0 → 1 comprehensive design pattern guide
- Future tool candidates: Database, File, Git operations identified for consolidation
- Developer understanding: Clear when to consolidate vs when to keep separate

**Business Impact:**
- Establishes scalable architecture pattern for Agent OS growth
- Reduces future technical debt through consistent design
- Enables faster feature development (proven pattern to follow)
- Improves developer onboarding (consistent patterns across tool surface)
- Creates competitive differentiation through superior tool architecture

### Goal 3: Maintain Feature Completeness While Improving Developer Experience

**Objective:** Provide all 18 workflow operations (discovery, execution, management, recovery, debugging) through a single, well-documented interface.

**Success Metrics:**
- Feature coverage: 18 actions (100% of current functionality)
- Action categories: 5 well-organized categories
- Documentation quality: Single comprehensive docstring vs 8 separate docstrings
- API learning curve: 8 separate APIs → 1 unified API with action parameter
- Migration support: Deprecation wrapper availability for smooth transition

**Business Impact:**
- No feature regression during consolidation
- Improved developer experience through unified, discoverable API
- Reduced documentation maintenance burden (1 tool vs 8 tools)
- Easier integration testing (single tool surface)
- Better discoverability for AI agents (one place for all workflow operations)

## 6. Out of Scope

Explicitly defines what is NOT included. Items may be considered for future phases.

### Explicitly Excluded

#### Features

**Not Included in This Release:**

1. **Advanced Discovery Actions (get_metadata, search)**
   - **Reason:** Basic list_workflows action is sufficient for v1; semantic search and detailed metadata can be added in future if needed
   - **Future Consideration:** Potential Phase 2 if usage shows need for more sophisticated discovery

2. **Workflow Authoring Tools (create_workflow, validate_workflow)**
   - **Reason:** Workflow creation is a complex multi-phase process best handled through workflows themselves (workflow_creation_v1)
   - **Future Consideration:** Remains out of scope - authoring through workflows is the pattern

3. **Migration Period / Deprecation Wrappers**
   - **Reason:** Clean cutover provides clearer experience with no confusion between old and new tools
   - **Future Consideration:** Not applicable - clean cutover is one-time

4. **GUI/Web Interface for Workflow Management**
   - **Reason:** Tool is designed for programmatic MCP access by AI agents, not human UI
   - **Future Consideration:** Potential separate project if human workflow management UI is needed

5. **Real-Time Workflow Streaming / WebSockets**
   - **Reason:** Current request/response pattern sufficient for AI agent workflows
   - **Future Consideration:** Could be added if streaming progress updates become necessary

6. **Workflow Marketplace / Sharing Features**
   - **Reason:** Workflow distribution handled through standard git/filesystem mechanisms
   - **Future Consideration:** Not planned - file-based distribution is sufficient

#### Workflow Engine Modifications

**Not Included:**

- **Workflow Definition Format Changes**: YAML structure remains unchanged
- **Phase Gating Logic Changes**: Checkpoint validation behavior unchanged
- **State Management Refactoring**: Existing state file format preserved
- **Workflow Discovery System Changes**: Metadata-based discovery unchanged

**Reason:** This spec consolidates tool surface only - workflow engine internals remain stable

#### Backward Compatibility Support

**Not Included:**

- **Support for Old Tool Names**: No wrappers for start_workflow, get_current_phase, etc.
- **Configuration Migration**: No automatic config updates
- **Dual Tool Support Period**: No period where both old and new tools coexist

**Reason:** Clean cutover eliminates complexity and confusion

#### Advanced Features

**Not Included:**

- **Workflow Composition**: Chaining multiple workflows
- **Conditional Branching**: Dynamic phase selection based on conditions
- **Parallel Phase Execution**: Multiple phases running concurrently
- **Workflow Templates**: Pre-configured workflow instances
- **Workflow Analytics Dashboard**: Usage statistics and visualization

**Reason:** These are potential future enhancements - current spec focuses on tool consolidation

---
