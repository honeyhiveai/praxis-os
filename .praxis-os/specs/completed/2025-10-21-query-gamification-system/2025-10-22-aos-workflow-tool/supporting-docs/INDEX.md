### 1. Consolidated Workflow Tool Design

**File:** `consolidated-workflow-tool-design-2025-10-15.md`  
**Type:** Technical design document / Analysis  
**Purpose:** Comprehensive design for consolidating 17+ workflow tools into a single `aos_workflow` tool following the same pattern as `aos_browser`. Includes complete API specification, usage examples, implementation plan, and rationale.

**Relevance:** Requirements [H], Design [H], Implementation [H]

**Key Topics:**
- Tool consolidation pattern (single tool with action dispatch)
- 18 workflow actions across 5 categories (Discovery, Execution, Management, Recovery, Debugging)
- Comparison with `aos_browser` design pattern
- Tool count optimization (24 tools → 5 tools, 79% reduction)
- API specification with all parameters and actions
- Complete usage examples for all action categories
- Implementation plan (phased approach)
- Migration strategy options

**Standout Insights:**
- Workflows ARE like browser automation - both are complex domains that benefit from consolidation
- Workflow authoring should be handled through workflows themselves, not separate tools
- Consistent naming pattern: `aos_workflow` matches `aos_browser`
- Phase-gated implementation: Core actions (Week 1) → Advanced actions (Week 2) → Polish (Week 3)
- 5-tool surface provides optimal LLM performance (~95% accuracy)

## Cross-Document Analysis

**Common Themes:**
- Single document provides complete design, no cross-referencing needed
- Emphasizes consistency with existing `aos_browser` pattern
- Focus on tool count reduction for LLM performance optimization

**Potential Conflicts:**
- None - single source document

**Coverage Gaps:**
- Testing strategy for the consolidated tool (mentioned but not detailed)
- Error handling implementation details
- Performance benchmarking criteria
- Backward compatibility considerations beyond deprecation wrappers
- Integration with existing workflow engine infrastructure

## Next Steps

This index will be used in Task 3 to systematically extract insights from the document. The extracted insights will be organized by:
- **Requirements Insights:** Business goals for consolidation, user needs, functional requirements for all 18 actions
- **Design Insights:** Action dispatch architecture, parameter structure, session management, consistency with aos_browser pattern
- **Implementation Insights:** Three-phase implementation plan, migration strategy, code patterns, validation approach
