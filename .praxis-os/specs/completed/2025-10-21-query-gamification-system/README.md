# Query Gamification System

**Status:** Draft  
**Priority:** High  
**Category:** Enhancement  
**Date:** 2025-10-21

---

## Executive Summary

The Query Gamification System is a behavioral reinforcement enhancement that maintains the AI agent's query-first behavior throughout extended conversations. By tracking query diversity and providing real-time feedback via `search_standards()` prepend messages, it prevents the common pattern of agents abandoning best practices after the first 10 messages. This zero-dependency, in-process enhancement adds ~85 tokens per query while preventing significant rework costs from query degradation.

**Key Benefits:**
- Sustains 5-10 queries per task throughout entire conversations (vs. dropping to 1-2 queries)
- Prevents behavioral drift that causes quality degradation and expensive rework
- Near-zero latency overhead (<1ms) with minimal memory footprint (~2KB per session)
- Zero external dependencies - fully in-process enhancement

## Overview

### What This Feature Does

The Query Gamification System uses completion mechanics (progress indicators like "3/5 angles explored") to create psychological momentum that reinforces the AI agent's tendency to perform comprehensive, multi-angle discovery when searching standards. It intercepts `search_standards()` calls, classifies query angles, tracks diversity, and generates motivating prepend messages.

### Who It's For

- **Primary Users:** AI agents executing Agent OS Enhanced workflows who need sustained query behavior
- **Secondary Users:** Human users who benefit from higher-quality, more thoroughly researched agent outputs

### Success Metrics

- **Query frequency:** Sustained 5-10 queries per task (vs. dropping to 1-2 after message 10)
- **Angle diversity:** 3-4 unique angles per topic (vs. 1-2 repetitive angles)
- **Quality impact:** Reduced rework from query degradation (qualitative)
- **Performance:** <1ms latency overhead, ~85 token prepend cost

---

## Requirements Summary

### Business Goals

1. **Maintain Sustained Query-First Behavior:** Keep agents querying 5-10 times per task throughout conversations
2. **Prevent Single Query Syndrome:** Ensure diverse, multi-angle exploration (3-4+ unique angles per topic)
3. **Zero Production Impact:** Add enhancement without affecting performance, reliability, or existing workflows
4. **Enable Behavioral Observability:** Provide visibility into query patterns for optimization

### Key User Stories

- **Story 1:** As an AI agent executing tasks, I want to see my query progress (e.g., "3/5 queries") in real-time so that I'm aware of how thoroughly I've explored the topic
- **Story 2:** As an AI agent, I want to see which query angles I've explored (e.g., "Angles: Definition ✅, Practical ✅, Location ⬜") so I know what perspectives I'm missing
- **Story 3:** As an AI agent mid-task, I want motivating feedback (e.g., "Great momentum - discovered 4 unique angles!") when I perform comprehensive discovery

### Functional Requirements (Summary)

- **FR-001:** Session-Based Query Tracking - Track statistics per conversation session
- **FR-002:** Query Angle Classification - Classify queries into 5 angles (Definition, Location, Practical, Best Practice, Error Prevention)
- **FR-003:** Dynamic Prepend Generation - Generate context-aware prepend messages based on query stats
- **FR-004:** Integration into search_standards() - Automatically prepend messages to all search results
- **FR-005:** Session ID Extraction - Extract session IDs from MCP context with fallback to "unknown"

**Total:** 13 functional requirements

### Non-Functional Requirements (Summary)

- **Performance:** <1ms latency overhead, ~85 token prepend cost
- **Reliability:** 99.99% success rate, graceful degradation on failures
- **Maintainability:** Zero external dependencies, <500 lines of code
- **Compatibility:** 100% backward compatible with existing `search_standards()` behavior
- **Scalability:** Support 100+ concurrent sessions, 10,000+ queries per session
- **Security:** Hashed session IDs, no PII logging, defense against query injection
- **Usability:** Prepend messages <100 tokens, mobile-friendly emoji rendering

## Technical Design Summary

### Architecture

**Pattern:** Minimalist In-Process Enhancement using Interceptor Pattern

The system intercepts the `search_standards()` MCP tool function, adds gamification logic (classify → track → generate prepend), and returns enhanced results. No new infrastructure, no separate services, no persistence layer.

**Key Components:**
- **QueryClassifier:** Classifies queries into 5 angles using keyword matching
- **QueryTracker:** Tracks per-session query statistics in memory
- **PrependGenerator:** Generates dynamic prepend messages based on stats
- **SessionExtractor:** Extracts session IDs using dynamic countdown timer (20s initial, decreasing by 1s per query, 5s floor) for natural task boundary detection (~95% accuracy)
- **Integration Layer:** Modified `search_standards()` in `rag_tools.py`

### Technology Stack

- **Language:** Python 3.11+
- **Dependencies:** None (uses only Python stdlib)
- **Storage:** In-memory (no persistence)
- **Integration:** Direct function interception in `rag_tools.py`

### Data Models

- **QueryStats:** Dataclass tracking total queries, unique angles, last 5 queries, session ID, start timestamp
- **QueryAngle:** Literal type with 5 values (Definition, Location, Practical, BestPractice, ErrorPrevention)

### APIs

- **Enhanced search_standards():** Existing MCP tool with prepended results (backward compatible)
- **Internal APIs:** `classify_query_angle()`, `QueryTracker.record()`, `generate_query_prepend()`

## Implementation Plan

### Timeline

**Total Estimated Time:** 12-16 hours (1.5-2 days)

**Phases:**
1. **Phase 1 (4-5h):** Foundation - Implement core modules (classifier, tracker, prepend generator)
2. **Phase 2 (2-3h):** Integration - Modify `search_standards()` and integrate gamification
3. **Phase 3 (4-6h):** Testing - Unit tests, integration tests, performance tests
4. **Phase 4 (2-3h):** Finalization - Code review, documentation, deployment prep

### Key Milestones

- **Milestone 1:** Core modules implemented with unit tests - ~5 hours
- **Milestone 2:** Integration complete with working prepend messages - ~8 hours
- **Milestone 3:** All tests passing with >95% coverage - ~12 hours
- **Milestone 4:** Code reviewed and deployment-ready - ~16 hours

### Dependencies

- **Python 3.11+:** Required for modern type hints and dataclasses
- **MCP Server Context:** Session ID extraction depends on MCP context structure
- **Existing `search_standards()`:** Integration point in `mcp_server/tools/rag_tools.py`

## Risks and Mitigations

### Risk 1: Prepend Messages Distract From Content

**Impact:** Medium (could reduce result usefulness)  
**Probability:** Low (prepends are clearly demarcated)  
**Mitigation:** 
- Use visual separators (`---`) to distinguish prepend from content
- Keep prepends <100 tokens (target ~85)
- Test with real agents to validate non-intrusiveness

### Risk 2: Classification Accuracy Issues

**Impact:** Low (incorrect angle classification)  
**Probability:** Medium (keyword matching has limitations)  
**Mitigation:**
- Comprehensive keyword dictionary covering common patterns
- "Unknown" fallback for unclear queries
- Monitoring and tuning based on real-world usage

### Risk 3: Memory Leaks in Long-Running Sessions

**Impact:** Medium (server instability)  
**Probability:** Low (simple in-memory storage)  
**Mitigation:**
- Implement LRU eviction (100-session cap)
- Per-session query history limit (last 5 queries only)
- Memory usage monitoring and alerts

### Risk 4: Token Cost Accumulation

**Impact:** Low (increased API costs)  
**Probability:** High (prepend on every query)  
**Mitigation:**
- Optimize prepend length (target 85 tokens, max 95)
- No duplication of content (prepend only, no postpend)
- Monitor token usage vs. quality improvement ROI

## Out of Scope

**Not included in this release:**
- **Persistence:** No database storage (future: analytics persistence for trend analysis)
- **Advanced ML Classification:** Simple keyword matching only (future: NLP-based classification)
- **Cross-Session Analytics:** No aggregation across conversations (future: system-wide metrics)
- **User Configuration:** No per-agent customization (future: adjustable thresholds)
- **Real-Time Dashboard:** No visualization UI (future: web-based monitoring)
- **A/B Testing Framework:** No built-in experimentation (future: feature flags for variants)

**Future considerations:**
- Phase 2: Persistent analytics backend with trend analysis
- Phase 3: ML-based query classification for higher accuracy
- Phase 4: Admin dashboard for system-wide monitoring
