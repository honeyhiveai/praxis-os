## Consistency Review

### Cross-Reference Validation

**FR Requirements → specs.md Components:**
- [✅] All 13 FRs mapped to specific components/sections
- [✅] No orphaned requirements (all requirements have implementations defined)
- [✅] No orphaned components (all components trace to requirements)

**specs.md → tasks.md:**
- [✅] All 5 components have corresponding implementation tasks
- [✅] Task 1.1-1.4 implement the 4 core modules
- [✅] Task 2.1-2.3 integrate components
- [✅] All tasks reference specific specs.md sections

**tasks.md → implementation.md:**
- [✅] All task patterns referenced in code patterns section
- [✅] Testing strategy aligns with Task 3.1-3.4
- [✅] Deployment aligns with finalization tasks

### Terminology Consistency

**Key Terms Verified Across Documents:**
- ✅ "Query Gamification System" (consistent)
- ✅ "QueryAngle" (consistent - 5 literals)
- ✅ "QueryStats" (consistent dataclass)
- ✅ "QueryTracker" (consistent singleton)
- ✅ "Prepend" (consistent - feedback message)
- ✅ "Session ID" (consistent - hashed in logs)
- ✅ "Graceful degradation" (consistent - NFR-R1)
- ✅ "search_standards()" (consistent function name)

**Metric Consistency:**
- ✅ Latency target: ≤20ms (consistent across srd.md NFR-P2, specs.md Section 6, tasks.md)
- ✅ Memory target: ≤100KB for 100 sessions (consistent)
- ✅ Token target: ~85 tokens avg, ≤120 max (consistent)
- ✅ Coverage target: ≥90% (specs.md), ≥95% (tasks.md, implementation.md) - Minor variance acceptable
