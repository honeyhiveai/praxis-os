# Divio Documentation System Restructure - Specification

**Project:** Agent OS Enhanced Documentation Restructure  
**Created:** 2025-10-10  
**Status:** âœ… Complete - Ready for Implementation  
**Spec Version:** 1.0  

---

## Executive Summary

This specification defines a comprehensive restructuring of Agent OS Enhanced documentation using the Divio Documentation System framework. The project reorganizes existing content into four quadrants (Tutorials, How-To Guides, Reference, Explanation), creates new tutorial content teaching Agent OS's main vehicle (spec-driven development), and implements automated quality enforcement.

**Key Objectives:**
- **Improve onboarding:** Create guaranteed-success tutorials (â‰¥95% success rate)
- **Reduce time to value:** New users productive in <15 minutes
- **Enhance findability:** Implement type badges, search, and Divio-compliant structure
- **Automate quality:** CI/CD validation for compliance, broken links, and builds

**This is a reorganization and enhancement project, NOT a complete rewrite.** Existing documentation will be refactored to fit Divio quadrants, with new content added where gaps exist.

## Architectural Decisions

### AD-1: Divio Documentation System
**Decision:** Adopt Divio 4-quadrant framework  
**Rationale:** Proven framework for user-centric documentation structure  
**Alternative:** Custom categorization (rejected - reinventing wheel)

### AD-2: Type Badge System
**Decision:** Visual badges via React component based on frontmatter  
**Rationale:** Immediate visual cue for doc type, enforces categorization  
**Alternative:** Text labels only (rejected - less visible)

### AD-3: Automated Validation in CI/CD
**Decision:** Block PR merge on compliance/link failures  
**Rationale:** Prevent quality degradation, enforce standards  
**Alternative:** Warning-only (rejected - ignored warnings common)

### AD-4: Tutorial 1 Teaches Spec-Driven Development
**Decision:** First tutorial covers complete spec cycle (design â†’ spec_creation_v1 â†’ spec_execution_v1)  
**Rationale:** This IS Agent OS - users must understand the main vehicle first  
**Alternative:** Simple MCP query tutorial (rejected - misses core methodology)

### AD-5: User Testing Required for Tutorials
**Decision:** â‰¥95% success rate verified with 3+ real users  
**Rationale:** Guarantees tutorial quality, prevents assumptions about clarity  
**Alternative:** Author testing only (rejected - author bias)

### AD-6: MCP RAG Includes Documentation
**Decision:** Add `docs/content/` to RAG index  
**Rationale:** AI can query documentation via search_standards, self-referential improvement  
**Alternative:** Separate docs-only search (rejected - fragmentation)

## Risks & Mitigations

### Risk 1: Tutorial Success Rate <95%
**Impact:** High - Core metric for onboarding quality  
**Probability:** Medium  
**Mitigation:**
- Iterate based on user feedback
- Simplify steps if users struggle
- Test with diverse user backgrounds (OS, experience levels)
- Add screenshots and visual guidance
- Accept that 90-95% may be acceptable for complex tutorials

### Risk 2: Divio Compliance <90%
**Impact:** Medium - Quality metric, not functional blocker  
**Probability:** Low  
**Mitigation:**
- Run validation early and often during writing
- Use validation feedback to guide refactoring
- Accept that some docs may be hybrids (85-90%)
- Prioritize compliance for new content (tutorials, how-tos)

### Risk 3: Migration Takes Longer Than Estimated
**Impact:** Medium - Delays project completion  
**Probability:** Medium  
**Mitigation:**
- Prioritize critical content first (tutorials, how-to guides)
- Reference docs can be enhanced incrementally post-launch
- Automate repetitive tasks (link updates, frontmatter addition)
- Accept MVP and iterate (90% complete is better than 0%)

### Risk 4: Search Performance <500ms
**Impact:** Low - User experience degradation  
**Probability:** Low  
**Mitigation:**
- Optimize Algolia index settings
- Use contextual search and faceting
- Reduce index size if needed
- Fallback to client-side search if Algolia unavailable

### Risk 5: User Testing Recruitment Challenges
**Impact:** High - Can't verify tutorial success rate  
**Probability:** Medium  
**Mitigation:**
- Use internal team members unfamiliar with Agent OS
- Post in community forums/Discord for volunteer testers
- Offer incentives (e.g., early access, swag)
- Accept smaller sample size (3 users minimum) if recruitment difficult

## Out of Scope

The following are explicitly **NOT** included in this project:

1. **Video Tutorials:** Only text-based tutorials (video production resource-intensive)
2. **Interactive Playgrounds:** No embedded code execution (requires significant infrastructure)
3. **Multi-Language Support:** English only (translations future consideration)
4. **Community Forums:** No forum/discussion integration (Discord exists)
5. **API Version History:** No version-specific docs (single version maintained)
6. **Auto-Generated API Docs:** No docstring extraction (manual reference docs)
7. **PDF/eBook Exports:** Web-only documentation
8. **Advanced Search Features:** No faceted search, filters beyond Algolia defaults
9. **User Accounts/Personalization:** No login, saved searches, or personalized content
10. **Analytics Dashboard:** No built-in analytics (use external tools)
11. **Complete Documentation Rewrite:** Reorganization and enhancement, not greenfield
12. **Legacy Content Archive:** Old docs deleted, not archived (clean slate)
13. **Mobile-Specific Optimizations:** Responsive only (no native mobile app)
14. **Offline Documentation:** Online-only (no offline bundles)
15. **Third-Party Integration Testing:** Focus on Agent OS, not every possible integration

**Rationale:** These features require significant additional resources, complexity, or ongoing maintenance. Focus remains on core Divio restructure and quality automation.

## Getting Started with Implementation

### For Implementers

1. **Read Specification Documents in Order:**
   - Start: `srd.md` (understand requirements)
   - Then: `specs.md` (understand design)
   - Then: `tasks.md` (understand implementation plan)
   - Finally: `implementation.md` (understand patterns and best practices)

2. **Set Up Environment:**
   - Clone repository
   - Install Docusaurus dependencies: `cd docs && npm install`
   - Install Python dependencies for validation scripts: `pip install pyyaml markdown requests`

3. **Execute Phases Sequentially:**
   - Follow `tasks.md` phase-by-phase
   - Complete all tasks in a phase before advancing
   - Validate at each phase gate
   - Don't skip validation steps

4. **Use Validation Early:**
   - Run `validate-divio-compliance.py` after writing each doc
   - Run `validate-links.py` before committing
   - Build locally with `npm run build` to catch errors early

5. **Test Tutorials with Real Users:**
   - Recruit 3+ users per tutorial
   - Observe without intervention
   - Measure success rate and time
   - Iterate based on feedback

6. **Reference Implementation Patterns:**
   - Use templates in `implementation.md` Section 1
   - Follow examples for each doc type
   - Avoid anti-patterns documented

### For Reviewers

1. **Review Specification for Approval:**
   - Verify business goals align with organizational objectives
   - Confirm requirements are complete and testable
   - Validate technical design is sound and feasible
   - Check time estimates are reasonable

2. **Provide Feedback:**
   - Comment on unclear requirements
   - Suggest additions to out-of-scope items
   - Validate user stories match actual user needs
   - Approve or request changes

3. **Sign Off Before Implementation:**
   - Specification must be approved before code/content work begins
   - Changes during implementation require spec update and re-approval
