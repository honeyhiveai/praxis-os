# Software Requirements Document

**Project:** Agent OS Enhanced Documentation Restructure  
**Date:** 2025-10-10  
**Priority:** High  
**Category:** Enhancement

---

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document defines the requirements for restructuring Agent OS Enhanced documentation to achieve Divio framework compliance. The project focuses on reorganizing existing documentation, adding missing content types (tutorials and how-to guides), and refactoring mixed-type content to improve user onboarding, retention, and support efficiency.

### 1.2 Scope
This feature will reorganize the existing `docs/` directory structure to align with the Divio 4-quadrant framework (Tutorials, How-To Guides, Reference, Explanation), create new tutorial and how-to guide content to fill critical gaps, refactor existing mixed-content files to ensure type purity, and implement validation automation to maintain documentation quality standards.

**Critical Distinction:** This is a **documentation reorganization and enhancement project**, not greenfield documentation creation. Existing documentation files (intro.md, architecture.md, mcp-tools.md, etc.) will be audited, moved into new structure, and selectively refactored where needed. New content will be created only to fill identified gaps (tutorials, how-to guides, specific references).

---

## 2. Business Goals

### Goal 1: Increase Documentation Usability and Accessibility

**Objective:** Transform Agent OS documentation from 46% Divio compliant to 90%+ compliant, dramatically improving findability and usability for users at all experience levels.

**Success Metrics:**
- **Divio Compliance Score**: 46% → 90%+
- **Tutorial Coverage**: 0% → 20% (2 complete tutorials)
- **How-To Guide Coverage**: 8% → 20% (6 complete guides)
- **Documentation Findability**: Unknown → 85%+ (users find answers without external help)
- **Search Usage**: N/A → 1,000+ monthly searches

**Business Impact:**
- Reduces user abandonment after installation
- Enables self-service problem-solving
- Establishes Agent OS as documentation best-practice example
- Decreases onboarding friction for new users and team members

### Goal 2: Reduce Time to First Value

**Objective:** Enable new users to progress from Agent OS installation to implementing their first working feature in under 15 minutes through guaranteed-success tutorials.

**Success Metrics:**
- **Time to First Value**: Unknown → <15 minutes
- **Tutorial Completion Rate**: N/A (no tutorials exist) → 80%+
- **Tutorial Success Rate**: N/A → 95%+ (tutorials work every time across all platforms)
- **User Confidence**: Unknown → 90%+ (users feel confident after completing first tutorial)

**Business Impact:**
- Converts installation into active usage
- Demonstrates immediate value proposition
- Builds user confidence and investment in learning more
- Reduces early-stage abandonment rate

### Goal 3: Decrease Support Burden

**Objective:** Reduce documentation-related support tickets by 40% through comprehensive how-to guides that answer common user questions.

**Success Metrics:**
- **Support Tickets (docs-related)**: Current baseline → -40%
- **Self-Service Resolution Rate**: Unknown → 85%+ (users solve problems via docs without support)
- **Common Questions Coverage**: Current gaps → 100% (all common questions have how-to guides or reference docs)
- **Bounce Rate on Docs**: Unknown → <40%

**Business Impact:**
- Frees support team to handle complex/novel issues
- Scales documentation without proportional support growth
- Improves user satisfaction (faster answers than waiting for support)
- Reduces support costs over time

- **Documentation Satisfaction**: Unknown → 4.2+/5.0 average rating
- **Advanced Feature Adoption**: Unknown → measurable increase (users progress beyond basic usage)
- **Community Engagement**: Current level → measurable increase (users contribute back)

**Business Impact:**
- Builds active, engaged user community
- Increases lifetime value of each user
- Generates positive word-of-mouth and organic growth
- Enables community contributions through clear documentation structure

---

## 2.1 Supporting Documentation

The business goals above are informed by comprehensive analysis documented in:
- **DESIGN-DOC-Divio-Documentation-Restructure.md**: Section 1 (Business Requirements) provides detailed problem statement with current state analysis (46% Divio compliance, 0% tutorial coverage, 8% how-to coverage, mixed content types), success criteria with specific metrics, and user impact analysis.

See `supporting-docs/INDEX.md` for complete insights extraction organized by requirements, design, and implementation categories (73 total insights extracted).

**Key Insight from Supporting Docs:** Current documentation achieves 46% Divio compliance heavily skewed toward explanation content. Critical gaps include zero tutorials (users don't know how to use Agent OS after install), inadequate how-to guides (users can't solve specific problems), incomplete reference documentation, and mixed content types that violate separation of concerns. This restructure will address all four gaps through strategic reorganization and selective content additions.

---

## 3. User Stories

User stories describe the documentation needs from different user perspectives throughout their journey with Agent OS.

### Story Format

**As a** {user type}  
**I want to** {capability}  
**So that** {benefit}

---

### Story 1: New User Onboarding

**As a** developer new to Agent OS  
**I want to** a hands-on tutorial that walks me through the complete spec-driven development cycle  
**So that** I understand how to use Agent OS's main vehicle (spec creation → spec execution) to build features

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I have Agent OS installed
- When I follow the "Your First Agent OS Project" tutorial
- Then I successfully:
  - Have a design conversation with AI about a simple feature
  - Use "create a spec" to trigger `spec_creation_v1` workflow
  - Review generated spec artifacts (srd.md, specs.md, tasks.md, implementation.md)
  - Use "implement the spec" to trigger `spec_execution_v1` workflow
  - See working implementation with tests
- And the tutorial takes 15-20 minutes
- And success is guaranteed (works every time on any OS)
- And I understand that THIS is how you work in Agent OS

**Priority:** Critical

**Rationale:** The spec creation → spec execution cycle is THE MAIN VEHICLE for working in Agent OS. Without understanding this, users don't understand Agent OS. Tutorial must teach this end-to-end flow as the foundation, not just MCP/RAG queries.

---

### Story 2: Problem-Solving for Experienced Users

**As an** experienced Agent OS user  
**I want to** step-by-step guides for specific problems  
**So that** I can quickly solve issues without reading conceptual explanations

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I have a specific problem (e.g., "create custom standards", "debug workflows")
- When I access the relevant how-to guide
- Then I find actionable steps that solve my exact problem
- And steps are goal-oriented without unnecessary explanation
- And guide is adaptable to slightly different scenarios
- And links to explanation docs are provided for deeper understanding

**Priority:** Critical

**Rationale:** Experienced users know how Agent OS works but need quick answers for specific tasks. Searching through explanation docs is frustrating and time-consuming. How-to guides provide efficient problem resolution.

---

### Story 3: API and Structure Reference

**As a** developer integrating Agent OS into workflows  
**I want to** complete technical reference documentation  
**So that** I can look up syntax, parameters, and file structures without guessing

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I need to use an MCP tool, command language symbol, or edit a configuration file
- When I access the reference documentation
- Then I find complete information including syntax, parameters, examples, and edit safety warnings
- And every MCP tool is documented with working examples
- And every config file structure is documented with field descriptions
- And command language is fully referenced with AI obligations
- And file tree shows which files are safe to edit

**Priority:** High

**Rationale:** Users break Agent OS by editing the wrong files or misusing MCP tools due to incomplete reference documentation. Complete reference prevents errors and builds user confidence.

---

### Story 4: Understanding Architecture and Design Decisions

**As a** technical decision-maker evaluating Agent OS for adoption  
**I want to** deep explanations of architecture and design decisions  
**So that** I can understand why Agent OS works this way and evaluate fitness for our needs

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I need to understand how Agent OS works conceptually
- When I access explanation documentation
- Then I find "why" not "how" content explaining rationale
- And alternatives are discussed with tradeoffs
- And design decisions are justified with reasoning
- And content is separate from instructional content

**Priority:** High

**Rationale:** Decision-makers need to understand Agent OS philosophy, architecture, and design rationale before committing to adoption. Pure explanation content serves this need without mixing in instructional steps.

---

## 3.1 Story Priority Summary

**Critical (Must-Have):**
- Story 1: New User Onboarding - Addresses 0% tutorial coverage gap, directly impacts time to first value and user abandonment
- Story 2: Problem-Solving for Experienced Users - Addresses 8% how-to guide coverage gap, reduces support burden

**High Priority:**
- Story 3: API and Structure Reference - Addresses incomplete reference documentation (60% coverage), prevents user errors
- Story 4: Understanding Architecture and Design Decisions - Maintains existing strong explanation content, serves decision-maker needs

**User Personas Identified:**
1. **Primary Persona:** New Developer - Just installed Agent OS, technical background, wants to understand value quickly
2. **Secondary Persona:** Experienced User - Using Agent OS for a project, hits specific problems, needs quick solutions
3. **Tertiary Persona:** Integrator - Building workflows with Agent OS, needs API/config reference
4. **Quaternary Persona:** Decision-Maker - Evaluating Agent OS for team/organization adoption, needs conceptual understanding

---

## 3.2 Supporting Documentation

User needs from supporting documents:
- **DESIGN-DOC-Divio-Documentation-Restructure.md Section 1.3**: Provides detailed user story analysis with specific acceptance criteria for each user type (new user, experienced user, integrator, decision-maker)

See `supporting-docs/INDEX.md` for complete requirements insights extraction (23 requirement-related insights documented).

---

## 4. Functional Requirements

Functional requirements specify capabilities the documentation restructure must provide. Requirements organized by Divio framework quadrants plus infrastructure concerns.

## 6. Out of Scope

Explicitly defines what is NOT included in this documentation restructure project. Items may be considered for future phases but are not part of the current scope.

### Explicitly Excluded

#### Features

**Not Included in This Release:**

1. **Video Tutorials**
   - **Reason:** Written tutorials provide the foundation. Video production is time-intensive and should build on proven written content. Videos are a different medium requiring separate expertise and production workflow.
   - **Future Consideration:** Phase 2 (3 months post-launch) - Video versions of successful tutorials once written content is validated

2. **Interactive Playgrounds / Code Sandboxes**
   - **Reason:** Interactive environments require significant infrastructure (server-side execution, security sandboxing). Written tutorials with copy-paste code are sufficient for MVP and establish value before infrastructure investment.
   - **Future Consideration:** Phase 3 (6 months post-launch) - Interactive code playgrounds for live experimentation

3. **Translation / Internationalization (i18n)**
   - **Reason:** English documentation serves primary user base. Translation infrastructure (i18n framework, translation management, maintaining parity across languages) is substantial overhead. Focus on quality English content first.
   - **Future Consideration:** Phase 3 (6 months post-launch) - Translations if significant non-English user demand identified

4. **Versioned Documentation**
   - **Reason:** Currently single version of Agent OS in active use. Versioned docs add complexity (multiple doc builds, version switcher, maintaining multiple doc branches). Implement when Agent OS has multiple supported versions.
   - **Future Consideration:** When Agent OS releases v2.0 with breaking changes requiring parallel documentation

5. **Community Forums / Q&A System**
   - **Reason:** Different infrastructure and moderation requirements than static documentation. Forums/Q&A complement docs but require ongoing moderation resources. Focus on self-service documentation first.
   - **Future Consideration:** Phase 4 (12 months post-launch) - Integration with support ticketing or community platform if documentation alone proves insufficient

6. **Migration Guides from Other Systems**
   - **Reason:** Agent OS is unique framework without direct competitors. Migration guides require identifying comparable systems and documenting differences. No clear migration path to document currently.
   - **Future Consideration:** If Agent OS becomes established and users migrate from other AI frameworks, migration guides become valuable

7. **Advanced Performance Tuning Guides (Tier 4)**
   - **Reason:** Advanced optimization is niche use case. Core documentation (tutorials, how-to guides, reference, explanation) serves 95% of users. Advanced tuning is power-user territory better served after core docs are solid.
   - **Future Consideration:** Phase 2 (3 months post-launch) - Advanced how-to guides for performance optimization once core content proven successful

#### Content Scope

**Not Included:**

- **Complete Documentation Rewrite**: Existing documentation will be reorganized, audited, and selectively refactored - NOT rewritten from scratch. Good existing content is preserved and moved.
  - **Reason:** Wasteful to discard quality explanation content. Reorganization + selective additions more efficient and lower risk than wholesale rewrite.

- **Non-Documentation Website Changes**: Changes to branding, styling (beyond type badges), homepage design, or marketing content are out of scope.
  - **Reason:** Focus on documentation structure and content. Website design is separate concern.

- **Documentation for Unreleased Features**: Documentation scope limited to currently released Agent OS features. Future feature docs created when features release.
  - **Reason:** Documenting unreleased features risks documentation-code drift and wasted effort if features change.

#### Platforms

**Not Explicitly Supported:**

- **Internet Explorer 11 and Earlier**: Modern browsers only (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge - latest 2 versions)
  - **Reason:** IE11 usage negligible in developer community. Supporting legacy browsers increases build complexity and limits modern web features. Docusaurus default browser support is sufficient.

- **Print/PDF Documentation**: Documentation optimized for web viewing, not print or PDF export
  - **Reason:** Developer documentation consumed online. Print optimization (pagination, styling) is different effort. Web-first provides best search and navigation experience.

#### Quality Levels Beyond Defined NFRs

**Not Required:**

- **100% Tutorial Success Rate**: Target is 95%+, not 100%
  - **Reason:** 100% success rate unrealistic given environment variability. 95% provides high confidence while being achievable.

- **Perfect Divio Compliance (100%)**: Target is 90%+, minimum 80%
  - **Reason:** Some edge cases may not fit cleanly into single quadrant. Root-level special cases (installation.md, troubleshooting.md) serve specific purposes. Practical compliance over dogmatic purity.

- **Sub-100ms Search Response**: Target is <500ms, ideal <200ms
  - **Reason:** 500ms provides excellent user experience. Optimizing to sub-100ms has diminishing returns given network latency.

## 6.1 Future Enhancements

**Potential Phase 2 (3 Months Post-Launch):**
- Video versions of tutorials
- Additional how-to guides (advanced topics: performance tuning, custom workflow creation, advanced CI/CD patterns)
- More tutorial content (advanced workflows, multi-repo setups)
- Enhanced search features (faceted search, filters by doc type)

**Potential Phase 3 (6 Months Post-Launch):**
- Interactive code playgrounds
- Translation to other languages (Spanish, Chinese, Japanese based on demand)
- Versioned documentation (if Agent OS v2.0 releases)
- Advanced reference documentation (internal API docs, architecture deep-dives)

**Potential Phase 4 (12 Months Post-Launch):**
- Community contribution system
- Documentation metrics dashboard
- Automated content freshness checking
- Smart recommendations based on user behavior
- Integration with support ticketing system

**Explicitly Not Planned:**
- Complete rewrite of existing documentation (reorganization only)
- Non-documentation website changes (branding, marketing)
- Documentation for Agent OS forks or variants
- Commercial support documentation (separate concern)
- Documentation in formats other than web (PDF, ePub, print)

## 6.2 Supporting Documentation

Out-of-scope items from:
- **DESIGN-DOC-Divio-Documentation-Restructure.md Section 1.6**: Provides detailed out-of-scope list with 7 explicitly excluded items (video tutorials, interactive playgrounds, translations, versioned docs, community forums, migration guides, advanced tuning)
- **DESIGN-DOC-Divio-Documentation-Restructure.md Section 7**: Future enhancements roadmap organized by phase (2, 3, 4) with timeline and priorities

See `supporting-docs/INDEX.md` for complete requirements insights (23 insights) including explicit scope boundaries and rationale.

**Out-of-Scope Summary Count:**
- Features excluded: 7 items
- Content scope clarifications: 3 items
- Platform exclusions: 2 items
- Quality level boundaries: 3 items
- **Total: 15 explicitly defined boundaries**

**Critical Boundary:** This project is **reorganization of existing documentation with selective additions**, NOT greenfield documentation system creation. Existing content is preserved, moved, and enhanced - not discarded and rewritten. This boundary prevents scope creep into unnecessary rewriting.
