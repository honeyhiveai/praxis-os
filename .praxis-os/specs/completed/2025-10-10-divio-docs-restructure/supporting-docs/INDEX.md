**Spec:** Agent OS Enhanced Documentation Restructure  
**Created:** 2025-10-10  
**Total Documents:** 1

## Document Catalog

### 1. DESIGN-DOC-Divio-Documentation-Restructure.md

**File:** `DESIGN-DOC-Divio-Documentation-Restructure.md`  
**Type:** Comprehensive Design Document  
**Purpose:** Analyzes current Agent OS Enhanced documentation (46% Divio compliance), identifies critical gaps (zero tutorials, inadequate how-to guides, mixed content types), and provides complete design for restructuring existing documentation into Divio framework with specific content additions.

**Relevance:** Requirements [H], Design [H], Implementation [H]

**Key Topics:**
- Current documentation state (46% Divio compliant, existing files audit)
- Divio 4-quadrant framework (tutorial, how-to, reference, explanation)
- Gap analysis (0% tutorial coverage, 8% how-to coverage)
- Documentation REORGANIZATION strategy (not new creation)
- Content migration plan (what stays, what moves, what gets refactored)
- Specific missing content to ADD (tutorials, how-to guides, references)
- Existing content to REFACTOR (how-it-works.md mixed type issue)
- AI-oriented documentation design principles
- MCP/RAG integration with documentation
- Implementation phases and task breakdown (50-58 hours, 6 weeks)
- Testing strategy for documentation quality
- Success metrics and validation criteria

---

## Cross-Document Analysis

**Common Themes:**
- Documentation REORGANIZATION is core goal (not building from scratch)
- Existing content preservation (audit shows what to keep vs refactor)
- Divio compliance as measure of success (from 46% → 90%+)
- Content type separation (pure tutorial, pure how-to, pure reference, pure explanation)
- Concrete deliverables for each Divio quadrant
- Docusaurus as existing platform (enhance, not replace)

**Potential Conflicts:**
- None identified (single comprehensive source document)

**Coverage Gaps:**
- None (document is comprehensive covering requirements, design, and implementation)

**Critical Distinctions:**
- This is a **REORGANIZATION + ENHANCEMENT** project, NOT greenfield documentation creation
- Existing docs (`docs/content/intro.md`, `architecture.md`, etc.) already exist and need to be:
  - MOVED into new Divio structure
  - AUDITED for type purity
  - REFACTORED if mixed (e.g., how-it-works.md)
  - PRESERVED if already compliant
- NEW content to ADD:
  - 2 tutorials (currently 0%)
  - 6 how-to guides (currently inadequate)
  - 3 reference docs (command language, metadata, file structure)
  - 1 concepts/glossary
- Content creation is SELECTIVE ADDITIONS to fill gaps, not wholesale rewrite

## Extracted Insights

### Requirements Insights (Phase 1)

#### From DESIGN-DOC-Divio-Documentation-Restructure.md:

**Current State Problems:**
- **Gap:** Zero tutorials (0% coverage) - users install but don't know how to use Agent OS
- **Gap:** Inadequate how-to guides (8% coverage) - users can't solve specific problems
- **Gap:** Incomplete reference (60% coverage) - API/structure information scattered
- **Issue:** Mixed content types violating separation of concerns (e.g., how-it-works.md mixes explanation with instruction)
- **Metric:** Current Divio compliance score is 46%

**Business Goals:**
- **Primary:** Create Divio-compliant documentation serving users at every stage (46% → 90%+ compliance)
- **Metric:** Tutorial completion rate 80%+
- **Metric:** Time to first value <15 minutes
- **Metric:** Support ticket reduction -40%
- **Metric:** User retention 70%+ for tutorial completers
- **Metric:** Documentation findability 85%+

**User Stories:**
- **US-1:** New user needs hands-on 5-10 minute tutorial guaranteeing success with immediate results
- **US-2:** Experienced user needs step-by-step guides for specific problems without conceptual explanations
- **US-3:** Developer needs complete API reference for syntax, parameters, file structures
- **US-4:** Decision-maker needs deep explanations of architecture and design decisions

**Functional Requirements:**
- **FR-1:** Create 2 tutorials (First 5 Minutes, First Workflow) with 95%+ success rate
- **FR-2:** Create 6 how-to guides solving ONE specific problem each
- **FR-3:** Create 4 reference docs (MCP tools, command language, metadata, file structure)
- **FR-4:** Maintain existing explanation docs, separate from instruction
- **FR-5:** Reorganize docs/ into Divio 4-quadrant structure with type badges

**Non-Functional Requirements:**
- **NFR-1:** Tutorials 95%+ success rate, all examples tested, 0 broken links, 90%+ Divio compliance
- **NFR-2:** Templates for each doc type, contributing guide, automated CI/CD validation
- **NFR-3:** Mobile-responsive, <500ms search response, accessibility compliant
- **NFR-4:** Site loads <2 seconds, search <500ms results

**Out of Scope:**
- Video tutorials, interactive playgrounds, translations, versioned docs, community forums, migration guides, advanced performance tuning (explicitly NOT in this project)

**Critical Constraint:**
- This is REORGANIZATION + SELECTIVE ADDITIONS, not greenfield documentation creation
- Existing content must be preserved, audited, moved, or refactored - NOT rewritten wholesale

### Design Insights (Phase 2)

#### From DESIGN-DOC-Divio-Documentation-Restructure.md:

**Directory Structure:**
- **New:** `docs/content/tutorials/` with _category_.json, first-5-minutes.md, first-workflow.md
- **New:** `docs/content/how-to-guides/` with 6 guide files
- **Reorganize:** `docs/content/reference/` with mcp-tools.md (enhance existing), command-language.md (new), workflow-metadata.md (new), file-structure.md (new)
- **Reorganize:** `docs/content/explanation/` with intro.md (audit), architecture.md (audit), how-it-works.md (REFACTOR to remove instruction), concepts.md (new glossary)
- **Keep:** installation.md, upgrading.md at root (special cases)
- **Add:** troubleshooting.md, quick-reference.md at root

**Content Migration Table:**
| Existing File | Current Type | Target Type | Action Required |
|--------------|--------------|-------------|-----------------|
| intro.md | Explanation | Explanation | Audit for type purity |
| how-it-works.md | Mixed | Explanation | **REFACTOR** - remove instruction |
| architecture.md | Explanation | Explanation | Audit, add failure scenarios |
| mcp-tools.md | Reference | Reference | Enhance with more examples |
| installation.md | Mixed | Special case | Keep at root, minor edits |
| workflows.md | Explanation | Explanation | Audit, add comparison table |
| standards.md | Explanation | Explanation | Audit, add real examples |
| upgrading.md | Reference/How-to | Special case | Keep at root, minor edits |

**Tutorial Templates:**
- **Template 1:** "First 5 Minutes" - validate install (30s) → first RAG query (1m) → implement guidance (2m) → test (1m) → what you learned
- **Template 2:** "First Workflow" - start workflow (2m) → complete Phase 0 (3m) → experience checkpoint gating (2m) → advance through phases (5m) → review spec (2m)
- **Principles:** Learning by doing, guaranteed success, immediate results, concrete steps, minimum explanation

**How-To Guide Template:**
```markdown
# How To: [Specific Problem]
## Quick Answer (TL;DR)
## Step-by-Step Guide
### Step 1-3: [Actions]
## Variations
## Troubleshooting
## Related (links)
```

**Reference Structure:**
- **Command Language Reference:** Complete list of blocking (🛑), evidence (📊), warning (⚠️), navigation (🎯) commands with usage, meaning, examples, AI obligations
- **File Structure Reference:** Directory tree + edit safety matrix showing Agent OS owned vs user owned, overwritten on upgrade vs preserved
- **Metadata Reference:** workflow metadata.json schema and required fields

**Type Badge System:**
- Tutorial: 🎓 green (#10b981)
- How-To: 📖 blue (#3b82f6)
- Reference: 📚 purple (#8b5cf6)
- Explanation: 💡 orange (#f59e0b)
- Implemented as React component with frontmatter `doc_type` field

**Search Integration:**
- **Preferred:** Algolia DocSearch (free for open source)
- **Backup:** @easyops-cn/docusaurus-search-local plugin
- **Requirement:** <500ms response time

**Validation Automation:**
- **Script:** `scripts/validate-divio-compliance.py` checks doc_type frontmatter, calculates coverage by type, enforces 80%+ compliance score
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions workflow validates compliance, checks broken links, tests doc examples, builds docs
- **Pre-commit:** Link validation, code example testing

**AI-Oriented Design Principles:**
- Self-reinforcing patterns (every query includes reminder to query more, targeting 5-10 queries/task)
- Bootstrap + persistence (24-line .cursorrules triggers orientation query)
- Dynamic discovery over static lists (tools/list MCP protocol provides current tools, docs teach patterns not API details)
- Context efficiency as transformative (50KB → 2KB = 25x improvement enables frequent querying)
- Role clarity (AI is code author, not assistant - write 100% of code, iterate until quality gates pass)

### Implementation Insights (Phase 4)

#### From DESIGN-DOC-Divio-Documentation-Restructure.md:

**Phase Breakdown:**
- **Phase 1:** Tutorials (Weeks 1-2, 16-20 hours) - Research, create template, write 2 tutorials, test with 5+ users
- **Phase 2:** How-To Guides (Weeks 3-4, 14-16 hours) - Create template, write 4 guides minimum
- **Phase 3:** Reference (Week 5, 7 hours) - Command language, metadata, file structure references
- **Phase 4:** Explanation (Week 6, 5 hours) - Concepts/glossary, refactor how-it-works.md, audit existing
- **Phase 5:** Infrastructure (Week 6, 8-10 hours) - Reorganize directories, update Docusaurus config, create badge component, enable search, validation scripts
- **Total:** 50-58 hours across 6 weeks

**Task Dependencies:**
- Critical path: Tutorials → User Testing → Infrastructure → Validation
- Parallelization: Phases 2, 3, 4 can run in parallel after Phase 1

**Testing Strategy:**
- **Tutorial Testing:** Fresh install test, multi-OS test (macOS/Linux/Windows), 5+ user testing measuring success rate (95%+ target), time (±20% of estimate), confusion points (<2 per tutorial), satisfaction (4.5/5)
- **How-To Testing:** Scenario testing, variation testing, expert review
- **Reference Testing:** Completeness check, accuracy check (examples tested), link validation
- **Overall:** Divio compliance script (≥80%), link checker (0 broken), build test, search test

**Rollout Plan:**
- **Stage 1:** Internal review (Week 6) - team reviews, fix issues, internal validation
- **Stage 2:** Beta (Week 7) - deploy to docs-beta URL, 10-15 beta users, collect feedback, iterate
- **Stage 3:** Production (Week 8) - deploy to main site, announce, monitor analytics, quick-fix issues
- **Stage 4:** Measure & Iterate (Weeks 9-12) - track metrics, collect feedback, iterate, add missing content

**Docusaurus Configuration Examples:**
```typescript
// sidebars.ts structure with 4 categories (Tutorials, How-To, Reference, Explanation)
// Badge component with emoji + color coding
// Algolia search config with API key
```

**Validation Script Pattern:**
```python
# scripts/validate-divio-compliance.py
# Counts docs by doc_type frontmatter
# Calculates coverage percentages
# Compares to required coverage (tutorial 20%, how-to 20%, reference 25%, explanation 25%)
# Calculates compliance score (0-100%)
# Exits 0 if ≥80%, exits 1 if <80%
```

**Code Patterns:**
- Type badges use frontmatter `doc_type` field parsed by Docusaurus
- Category ordering controlled by `_category_.json` files
- Search integration via themeConfig in docusaurus.config.ts
- CI/CD uses GitHub Actions with multiple validation steps

**Success Criteria (Must Have for Launch):**
- 2 tutorials created and tested (95%+ success)
- 4 how-to guides created and tested
- 3 reference docs created
- Divio compliance ≥80%
- Zero broken links
- Documentation site builds and deploys
- Search functionality working

**Risk Mitigations:**
- Tutorial cross-OS reliability: Extensive testing on macOS, Linux, Windows with fallback instructions
- Time optimism: Buffer in timeline (6 weeks vs 5), prioritize ruthlessly
- User testing issues: Early prototype testing in Week 1, iterate quickly
- Divio confusion: Migration guide, both structures temporarily, analytics monitoring
- Search delays: Local search backup, can launch without and add later
- Low tutorial success: Extensive testing, iterate until target met, don't launch until ready

### Cross-References

**Validated by Multiple Sources:**
- N/A (single comprehensive source document)

**Conflicts:**
- None identified

**High-Priority Items:**
1. **Content migration strategy** - Must clearly distinguish reorganization from new creation
2. **how-it-works.md refactoring** - Explicitly identified as mixed content requiring refactoring
3. **Tutorial success rate** - 95%+ is critical, block launch if not met
4. **Type purity enforcement** - Each doc must fit ONE Divio quadrant
5. **Testing with real users** - 5+ users for each tutorial before launch
6. **Divio compliance validation** - Automated script enforces 80%+ threshold

## Insight Summary

**Total:** 73 insights  
**By Category:** Requirements [23], Design [28], Implementation [22]  
**Multi-source validated:** 0 (single source document)  
**Conflicts to resolve:** 0  
**High-priority items:** 6

**Key Distinction:** This project is about REORGANIZING EXISTING documentation (46% → 90% Divio compliant) and SELECTIVELY ADDING missing pieces (tutorials, how-to guides, some references), NOT creating a documentation system from scratch. Existing files must be audited, moved, and selectively refactored - not wholesale rewritten.

**Phase 0 Complete:** ✅ 2025-10-10

## Next Steps

These extracted insights will inform Phase 1 (srd.md creation), Phase 2 (specs.md creation), Phase 3 (tasks.md creation), and Phase 4 (implementation.md creation). All subsequent phases should reference this reorganization vs new creation distinction to ensure specifications correctly frame the project scope.
