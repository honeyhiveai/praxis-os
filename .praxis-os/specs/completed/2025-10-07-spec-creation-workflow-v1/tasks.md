## Dependencies

### Phase 1 â†’ Phase 2
Phase 2 (Phase Content) depends on Phase 1 (Structure) being complete.
Cannot write phase content without directory structure.

### Phase 2 â†’ Phase 3
Phase 3 (Validation) depends on Phase 2 (Content) being complete.
Validation criteria must match phase content requirements.

### Phase 3 â†’ Phase 4
Phase 4 (Testing) depends on Phase 3 (Validation) being functional.
Cannot test end-to-end without validation working.

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk: Phase 0 too complex for users
**Mitigation:** Make Phase 0 truly optional, provide clear guidance, include examples

### Risk: Validation too strict (blocks legitimate work)
**Mitigation:** Set reasonable minimums, allow user to skip with warning (future)

### Risk: Phase content too prescriptive
**Mitigation:** Provide templates but emphasize they're guidance, not requirements

### Risk: MCP queries fail
**Mitigation:** Cache query results, provide fallback static guidance

### Risk: Resume doesn't work correctly
**Mitigation:** Use workflow engine's state management, test thoroughly

---

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Validation functions: `tests/unit/test_spec_creation_validation.py`
- Phase 0 logic: `tests/unit/test_phase_0_skip.py`
- Target: >90% coverage

### Integration Tests
- Full workflow: `tests/integration/test_spec_creation_e2e.py`
- With supporting docs
- Without supporting docs

- Identify improvements

## Notes

- This workflow is **user-guided**, not AI-generated (AI doesn't write the spec)
- Command language (`ðŸ›‘ EXECUTE-NOW`) ensures binding
- Phase 0 is innovative - first workflow to integrate existing documents
- Quality gates ensure consistency and completeness
- Perfect pair with spec_execution_v1 (creation â†’ execution)

---

## Future Enhancements (Out of Scope)

- [ ] AI-assisted spec generation (AI writes content)
- [ ] Spec templates for common patterns
- [ ] Automated consistency checking (advanced NLP)
- [ ] Spec versioning and diff
- [ ] Approval workflow integration
- [ ] Multi-user collaboration

---

**Status:** Draft - Awaiting Approval  
**Next Step:** Review complete spec (all 5 files), approve, then implement Phase 1
