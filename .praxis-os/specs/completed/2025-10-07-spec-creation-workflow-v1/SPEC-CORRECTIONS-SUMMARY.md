# Spec Corrections Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-07  
**Spec:** spec_creation_v1  
**Status:** Corrected and ready for implementation

---

## 🎯 What Was Corrected

The original spec described a workflow structure that **violated workflow construction standards**. It was corrected to match the validated pattern from `spec_execution_v1`.

---

## ❌ Original Problems

### Problem 1: Incorrect File Sizes
- **Specified:** Phase files 200-300 lines, task files 60-100 lines
- **Reality:** Phase files ~80 lines, task files 100-170 lines
- **Impact:** Would create incorrectly-sized files

### Problem 2: Inline Tasks Pattern
- **Specified:** Tasks embedded inline within phase.md files
- **Reality:** Each task must be a separate file
- **Impact:** Would create 500+ line phase files (meta-workflow violation)

### Problem 3: No Concrete Structure
- **Specified:** Abstract descriptions of content
- **Reality:** Need exact templates showing structure
- **Impact:** Implementation uncertainty

---

## ✅ Corrections Applied

### 1. specs.md Updated

**Section 3 (Phase Content Structure):**
- ✅ Phase files: 200-300 → ~80 lines
- ✅ Task files: 60-100 → 100-170 lines
- ✅ Added complete phase.md template (matches spec_execution_v1)
- ✅ Added complete task.md template (matches spec_execution_v1)
- ✅ Clarified horizontal decomposition (one task = one file)

**Section 4 (Directory Structure):**
- ✅ Updated file size annotations
- ✅ Listed all task files explicitly
- ✅ Specified `phase.md` (not README.md)

---

### 2. tasks.md Updated

**Phase 2 Tasks (Content Creation):**

**Before:**
- Task 2.1: "Write `phases/0/phase.md` with full content"
- Implied creating large inline files

**After:**
- Task 2.1: "Write `phases/0/phase.md` (~80 lines) + create 3 separate task files (100-170 lines each)"
- Explicitly lists: task-1-copy-documents.md, task-2-create-index.md, task-3-extract-insights.md

**Applied to all phases:**
- Phase 0: 1 phase.md + 3 task files
- Phase 1: 1 phase.md + 5 task files
- Phase 2: 1 phase.md + 6 task files
- Phase 3: 1 phase.md + 5 task files
- Phase 4: 1 phase.md + 4 task files
- Phase 5: 1 phase.md + 3 task files

**Total:** 6 phase files + 26 task files

---

### 3. implementation.md Updated

**Section 4 (Phase Content Implementation):**

**Before:**
- Showed large inline examples (228+ lines)
- Phase 0 example was one big phase.md file

**After:**
- Added "CRITICAL: Follow Workflow Construction Standards" header
- Listed files to create for each phase
- Phase file example: ~80 lines (overview only)
- Task file example: 100-170 lines (detailed execution)
- Reference to `universal/standards/workflows/workflow-construction-standards.md`

**Removed:**
- Long inline phase content examples
- Abstract descriptions without file breakdown

**Added:**
- Concrete file lists for each phase
- Clear pattern: "Phase file provides overview (~80 lines), each task file contains detailed steps (100-170 lines)"
- References to validated working workflow (spec_execution_v1)

---

## 📚 New Standards Created

### Workflow Construction Standards

**File:** `universal/standards/workflows/workflow-construction-standards.md`

**Contents:**
- Standard workflow directory structure
- Phase file standard (~80 lines, required sections)
- Task file standard (100-170 lines, required sections)
- File size guidelines with rationale
- Command language requirements
- Validation checklist
- Common mistakes to avoid
- Examples from working workflows

**Purpose:** Provides definitive reference for workflow authors

**Location:** In universal standards (will ship with skeleton/template)

## 🎓 Key Lessons

### Lesson 1: Measure Actual Working Systems
- Don't guess at file sizes
- Measure actual working workflows
- Use empirical data

### Lesson 2: Dogfood Early
- Test spec against existing patterns before implementing
- Compare with validated working examples
- Catch structural issues before coding

### Lesson 3: Concrete > Abstract
- Provide exact templates, not descriptions
- Show file lists explicitly
- Include size specifications

### Lesson 4: Standards Need Domain-Specific Application
- Meta-framework principles exist
- Need workflow-specific standards
- Show concrete application with examples

## ✅ Status

**Spec Quality:** ✅ High (matches validated patterns)  
**Ready for Implementation:** ✅ Yes  
**Standards Documented:** ✅ Yes  
**Lessons Captured:** ✅ Yes

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. ✅ Spec corrected
2. ✅ Standards created and shipped to universal/
3. ⏭️ **Start implementation** using `spec_execution_v1` workflow
4. ⏭️ **Dogfood end-to-end** to validate corrections
5. ⏭️ **Fix test-generation** workflow (rename README.md → phase.md)

---

**The spec now accurately reflects how to build a compliant prAxIs OS workflow following validated patterns.**
