# Software Requirements Document

**Project:** Spec Creation Workflow (spec_creation_v1)  
**Date:** 2025-10-07

---

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

Define requirements for `spec_creation_v1` - a systematic workflow that guides users through creating comprehensive specifications with phase-gated validation and supporting document integration.

### 1.2 Scope

This workflow provides structured guidance for creating specs, with optional integration of pre-existing analysis/research documents (Phase 0), followed by requirements gathering, technical design, task breakdown, implementation guidance, and finalization.

### 1.3 Definitions

- **Spec**: A complete specification following the 5-file standard (README, srd, specs, implementation, tasks)
- **Phase**: A major stage in spec creation with validation gates
- **Supporting Documents**: Pre-existing analysis, research, or design documents
- **Phase 0**: Optional phase for integrating supporting documents
- **Validation Gate**: Checkpoint requiring evidence before advancing
- **Workflow Session**: Stateful execution of the workflow with resume capability

## 8. Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Phase 0 too complex | Medium | Make optional, clear docs |
| Validation too strict | Medium | Set reasonable minimums |
| MCP queries fail | Low | Provide fallback guidance |
| Resume doesn't work | High | Test thoroughly, use workflow_engine state |

## 9. Future Enhancements (Out of Scope)

- AI-assisted spec generation (AI writes content)
- Spec templates for common patterns
- Automated consistency checking (advanced)
- Spec versioning and changelog
- Multi-user collaboration
- Approval workflow integration
