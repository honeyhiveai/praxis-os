# Spec Creation Workflow (spec_creation_v1)

**Date:** 2025-10-07  
**Status:** Draft - Pending Approval  
**Priority:** High  
**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 days

---

## Executive Summary

Implement `spec_creation_v1` - a systematic, phase-gated workflow for creating comprehensive specifications with validation gates, supporting document integration, and automatic standards querying.

**Core Innovation:** Transforms ad-hoc spec creation into a structured, resumable workflow with quality gates.

---

## Problem Statement

**Current State:**
- `.cursor/rules/create-spec.mdc` provides ad-hoc guidance
- No state tracking (can't resume if interrupted)
- No validation between spec sections
- Manual file creation and standards querying
- No systematic integration of existing analysis/research documents
- Inconsistent spec quality

**Pain Points:**
1. Specs created with different structures/completeness
2. Easy to miss critical sections (security, performance, etc.)
3. No validation that requirements match design
4. Can't resume spec creation if interrupted
5. Pre-existing analysis/research documents not systematically incorporated
6. No enforcement of baseline quality standards

---

## Solution Overview

Create `spec_creation_v1` workflow with:

### 6 Phases
- **Phase 0:** Supporting Documents Integration (optional)
- **Phase 1:** Requirements Gathering (srd.md)
- **Phase 2:** Technical Design (specs.md)
- **Phase 3:** Task Breakdown (tasks.md)
- **Phase 4:** Implementation Guidance (implementation.md)
- **Phase 5:** Finalization (README.md + validation)

### Key Features
1. **Phase-Gated:** Each phase validates before advancing
2. **Resumable:** Can interrupt and continue later
3. **Standards-Integrated:** Automatic MCP queries for guidance
4. **Supporting Docs:** Phase 0 incorporates pre-existing documents
5. **Quality-Assured:** Validation checkpoints ensure completeness
6. **Consistent:** Same structure every time

---

## Design Principles

1. **Systematic:** Follow same process every time
2. **Resumable:** Save state, allow interruption
3. **Quality-Gated:** Validate before advancing
4. **Standards-Driven:** Query MCP for best practices
5. **Context-Preserving:** Integrate existing work (Phase 0)
6. **User-Guided:** Clear instructions at each step

---

## Scope

### In Scope
- Workflow metadata (metadata.json)
- Phase content files (phases/0-5/)
- Supporting documents integration (Phase 0)
- Validation gates at each phase
- MCP tool integration
- Documentation and examples

### Out of Scope
- Automated spec generation (AI writes spec) - remains human-guided
- Spec templates (workflow provides structure, not content)
- Approval workflow (separate concern)
- Version control of specs (use git)

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Workflow creates consistent, complete specs
- [ ] Each phase has clear validation criteria
- [ ] Supporting documents integrated smoothly (Phase 0)
- [ ] Can resume interrupted spec creation
- [ ] Standards automatically queried via MCP
- [ ] All 5 spec files created with proper structure
- [ ] Dogfooded: Use workflow to create a real spec
- [ ] Documentation complete

## Benefits Over Current Approach

| Feature | Current (.cursor/rules) | spec_creation_v1 |
|---------|------------------------|------------------|
| State Tracking | ❌ None | ✅ Resume if interrupted |
| Validation Gates | ❌ Manual | ✅ Enforced checkpoints |
| Standards Integration | ❌ Manual query | ✅ Automatic MCP queries |
| Progress Visibility | ❌ None | ✅ get_workflow_state() |
| Quality Assurance | ❌ Hope for best | ✅ Validation at each phase |
| Supporting Docs | ❌ Manual copy | ✅ Automated integration |
| Completeness Check | ❌ Manual | ✅ Checkpoint validation |

## Integration Points

### With spec_execution_v1
Perfect workflow chaining:
```
spec_creation_v1 → Creates spec
         ↓
spec_execution_v1 → Implements spec
```

### With MCP RAG
Automatic standards queries:
- Requirements standards
- Architecture patterns
- Testing best practices
- Production code checklist

## Deliverables

1. **Workflow Structure**
   - `universal/workflows/spec_creation_v1/metadata.json`
   - `universal/workflows/spec_creation_v1/phases/0-5/`

2. **Phase Content**
   - Phase 0: Supporting documents integration
   - Phase 1: Requirements gathering guide
   - Phase 2: Technical design guide
   - Phase 3: Task breakdown guide
   - Phase 4: Implementation guide
   - Phase 5: Finalization and validation

3. **Documentation**
   - Update `universal/usage/creating-specs.md`
   - Add examples
   - Usage guide for Phase 0 (supporting docs)

4. **Validation**
   - Dogfood: Create a real spec using this workflow
   - Verify all validation gates work
   - Test resume capability
