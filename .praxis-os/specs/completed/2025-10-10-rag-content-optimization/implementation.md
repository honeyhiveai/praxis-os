# Implementation Guide - RAG Content Optimization

**Project:** RAG Content Optimization  
**Date:** 2025-10-10  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Audience:** Content authors implementing optimizations

---

## 1. Content Optimization Patterns

### 1.1 TL;DR Pattern

**When to Use:**
- Files >150 lines
- Complex technical standards
- Files frequently queried for "quick reference"

**Structure:**
```markdown
# [Topic Name]

[Brief description paragraph]

---

## üö® [Topic] Quick Reference (TL;DR)

**Critical information:**
1. **[Key Point 1]** - [One sentence explanation]
2. **[Key Point 2]** - [One sentence explanation]
3. **[Key Point 3]** - [One sentence explanation]

**When to query:**
- [Scenario 1] ‚Üí `search_standards("[query]")`
- [Scenario 2] ‚Üí `search_standards("[query]")`

**Questions this answers:**
- "[Natural language question 1]"
- "[Natural language question 2]"
- "[Natural language question 3]"

---
```

**Concrete Example - SOLID Principles:**
```markdown
# SOLID Principles

Timeless design principles for maintainable, flexible object-oriented code.

---

## üö® SOLID Quick Reference (TL;DR)

**Critical information:**
1. **Single Responsibility** - One class, one reason to change
2. **Open/Closed** - Open for extension, closed for modification
3. **Liskov Substitution** - Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types
4. **Interface Segregation** - Many small interfaces > one large interface
5. **Dependency Inversion** - Depend on abstractions, not concretions

**When to query:**
- Designing new classes ‚Üí `search_standards("how to design maintainable classes")`
- Code review fails ‚Üí `search_standards("class design principles")`
- Making code testable ‚Üí `search_standards("dependency injection")`

**Questions this answers:**
- "How do I design maintainable classes?"
- "What are the SOLID principles?"
- "When should I split a class?"
- "How do I make code more testable?"
- "What is dependency inversion?"

---
```

**Anti-Pattern:**
```markdown
# SOLID Principles

This document describes the SOLID principles.

## Single Responsibility Principle
A class should have only one reason to change...
```
‚ùå **Why this fails:** No TL;DR for long file, no query hooks, generic title

---

### 1.2 Query Hooks Pattern

**When to Use:**
- Every file (mandatory)
- Especially files that answer "how to" questions
- Usage guides and behavioral standards

**Structure:**
```markdown
## Questions This Answers

- "[Natural question AI agent would ask]"
- "[Another natural question]"
- "[Third question covering different angle]"
- "[Fourth question using different terminology]"
- "[Fifth question about related concept]"
```

**Placement:** After TL;DR (if present), before main content

**Concrete Example - Integration Testing:**
```markdown
## Questions This Answers

- "How do I test components working together?"
- "What is integration testing?"
- "When should I write integration tests?"
- "How do I test database interactions?"
- "How do I test API integrations?"
- "What's the difference between unit and integration tests?"
- "How do I mock external dependencies in integration tests?"
```

**Best Practices:**
- 5-10 questions minimum
- Use natural language (how AI agents actually query)
- Cover different phrasings of same concept
- Include synonym terms (e.g., "integration tests" vs "component tests")
- Mix "how", "what", "when", "why" questions

**Anti-Pattern:**
```markdown
## Overview

This section explains integration testing...
```
‚ùå **Why this fails:** No explicit questions, not query-optimized

---

### 1.3 Query-Oriented Headers Pattern

**Principle:** Headers should match natural language queries

**Transformation Rules:**

| Generic Header | Query-Oriented Header |
|----------------|----------------------|
| "Overview" | "What Is [Topic]?" or "Why Use [Topic]?" |
| "Benefits" | "Why Use [Topic]?" or "What Problems Does [Topic] Solve?" |
| "Usage" | "How to Use [Topic]" or "When to Use [Topic]" |
| "Implementation" | "How to Implement [Topic]" |
| "Best Practices" | "How to [Do Topic] Correctly" |
| "Common Mistakes" | "What to Avoid When [Doing Topic]" |
| "Examples" | "How to [Do Topic] (Examples)" |

**Concrete Example - Test Pyramid:**

‚ùå **Before (Generic):**
```markdown
## Overview
## The Pyramid Structure
## Benefits
## Implementation
## Best Practices
```

‚úÖ **After (Query-Oriented):**
```markdown
## What Is the Test Pyramid?
## How Should Test Types Be Distributed? (The Pyramid Structure)
## Why Use the Test Pyramid Strategy?
## How to Implement the Test Pyramid
## How to Maintain a Healthy Test Pyramid (Best Practices)
```

**Best Practices:**
- Keep original term in parentheses if needed
- Use question format when appropriate
- Include action verbs (implement, maintain, design, test)
- Preserve document hierarchy (H2, H3, H4)
- Don't over-optimize (keep it readable)

---

### 1.4 Query Teaching Pattern

**Purpose:** Explicitly teach AI agents when and how to query this content

**Structure:**
```markdown
## When to Query This Standard

This standard is most valuable when:

1. **[Use Case 1]**
   - Situation: [Description]
   - Query: `search_standards("[example query]")`

2. **[Use Case 2]**
   - Situation: [Description]
   - Query: `search_standards("[example query]")`

[Continue for 4-7 scenarios]

### Query by Use Case

| Use Case | Example Query |
|----------|---------------|
| [Scenario] | `search_standards("[query]")` |
| [Scenario] | `search_standards("[query]")` |
```

**Placement:** After main content, before related standards

**Concrete Example - Production Code Checklist:**
```markdown
## When to Query This Standard

This standard is most valuable when:

1. **Before Writing Any Production Code**
   - Situation: Starting new feature or module
   - Query: `search_standards("production code quality checklist")`

2. **During Code Review**
   - Situation: Reviewing PR for production readiness
   - Query: `search_standards("production code requirements")`

3. **After Linter Errors**
   - Situation: Code has linter warnings or type errors
   - Query: `search_standards("linter errors production code")`

4. **Before Committing Code**
   - Situation: Final validation before commit
   - Query: `search_standards("code quality checklist before commit")`

5. **When Code Seems "Done" But Feels Wrong**
   - Situation: Functional code that doesn't feel production-ready
   - Query: `search_standards("is my code production ready")`

### Query by Use Case

| Use Case | Example Query |
|----------|---------------|
| Starting new feature | `search_standards("production code quality checklist")` |
| Code review | `search_standards("production code requirements")` |
| Linter errors | `search_standards("linter errors production code")` |
| Before commit | `search_standards("code quality checklist before commit")` |
| Testing strategy | `search_standards("how to test production code")` |
```

**Best Practices:**
- 4-7 scenarios (not too few, not overwhelming)
- Include exact `search_standards()` syntax
- Describe triggering situation clearly
- Mix different query phrasings
- Include table for quick reference

---

### 1.5 Cross-Reference Pattern

**Purpose:** Create query workflows and explicit navigation paths

**Structure:**
```markdown
## Related Standards

**Architecture & Design:**
- `standards/architecture/solid-principles.md` - Timeless class design principles
  ‚Üí `search_standards("how to design maintainable classes")`

**Testing:**
- `standards/testing/test-pyramid.md` - Universal testing strategy
  ‚Üí `search_standards("how to structure my tests")`

**Quality:**
- `standards/ai-safety/production-code-checklist.md` - Pre-commit quality checklist
  ‚Üí `search_standards("production code quality requirements")`

**Query workflow:**
1. **Before**: `search_standards("how to design classes")` ‚Üí SOLID principles
2. **During**: `search_standards("how to test classes")` ‚Üí Test Pyramid + Test Doubles
3. **After**: `search_standards("production code checklist")` ‚Üí Final validation
```

**Placement:** End of file (last section)

**Best Practices:**
- Group by category (Architecture, Testing, Security, etc.)
- Include file path + description + example query for each
- Provide "Query workflow" for sequential standards
- Minimum 3 related standards, maximum ~8
- Link to standards commonly queried together

**Anti-Pattern:**
```markdown
## Related

- SOLID Principles
- Test Pyramid
- Production Code Checklist
```
‚ùå **Why this fails:** No paths, no queries, no context

---

### 1.6 Complete Gold Standard Example

**File:** `standards/testing/integration-testing.md`

```markdown
# Integration Testing - Testing Component Interactions

Universal testing strategy for verifying components work together correctly.

---

## üö® Integration Testing Quick Reference (TL;DR)

**Critical information:**
1. **Definition** - Tests verify multiple components/modules working together with real dependencies
2. **Four Types** - API integration, database integration, service integration, system integration
3. **Key Difference** - Uses real external dependencies (databases, APIs) unlike unit tests (mocks)
4. **Test Pyramid Position** - Middle layer: fewer than unit tests, more than E2E (aim for 20-30% of test suite)
5. **Common Gotchas** - Slow execution, environment dependencies, flaky tests, difficult debugging

**When to query:**
- Testing database interactions ‚Üí `search_standards("how to test database interactions")`
- Testing API integrations ‚Üí `search_standards("testing api integrations")`
- Deciding unit vs integration ‚Üí `search_standards("unit vs integration tests")`

**Questions this answers:**
- "How do I test components working together?"
- "What is integration testing?"
- "When should I write integration tests?"
- "How do I test database interactions?"
- "How do I test API integrations?"
- "What's the difference between unit and integration tests?"
- "How do I handle external dependencies in tests?"

---

## üéØ Purpose

Integration tests verify that separate modules/components work together correctly when integrated. Unlike unit tests that isolate components with mocks, integration tests use real dependencies to catch interface mismatches, configuration errors, and system integration issues.

---

## What Is Integration Testing?

Integration testing validates that multiple components/modules of a system work together correctly. These tests:

- Use **real** external dependencies (databases, message queues, third-party APIs)
- Test **interfaces** between components
- Verify **data flow** through system boundaries
- Catch **integration issues** that unit tests miss

[... continue with main content ...]

---

## When to Query This Standard

This standard is most valuable when:

1. **Testing Database Interactions**
   - Situation: Need to verify ORM queries, transactions, migrations
   - Query: `search_standards("how to test database interactions")`

2. **Testing API Integrations**
   - Situation: Integrating with third-party services or internal APIs
   - Query: `search_standards("testing api integrations")`

3. **Deciding Test Strategy**
   - Situation: Unsure whether to write unit or integration test
   - Query: `search_standards("unit vs integration tests when to use")`

4. **Debugging Flaky Tests**
   - Situation: Integration tests failing intermittently
   - Query: `search_standards("flaky integration tests debugging")`

### Query by Use Case

| Use Case | Example Query |
|----------|---------------|
| Database testing | `search_standards("how to test database interactions")` |
| API integration | `search_standards("testing api integrations")` |
| Test strategy | `search_standards("unit vs integration tests")` |
| Flaky tests | `search_standards("flaky integration tests")` |

```

---

## 2. Validation Strategy

### 2.1 Scoring Rubric Application

**Process:**

1. **Read complete file** (don't skip sections)
2. **Apply 9-point checklist** (see section 2.2)
3. **Calculate score** (0-10)
4. **Assign status** (Exemplary/Good/Adequate/Poor)
5. **Document findings** (what works, what needs improvement)

**Scoring Formula:**

```
Total Points = Sum of all criterion scores
Final Score = min(10, Total Points)

Status:
  9-10 = Exemplary
  7-8  = Good
  5-6  = Adequate
  0-4  = Poor
```

---

### 2.2 Evaluation Checklist

```

---

### 2.3 Test Query Validation

**After optimizing a file, validate with test queries:**

**Step 1: Identify Relevant Queries**
- 3-5 queries that should return this file
- Based on "Questions This Answers" section
- Natural language (how AI agents query)

**Step 2: Execute Queries**
```python
# Example test
search_results = search_standards("how to test database interactions")
assert "integration-testing.md" in search_results[:3]  # Top 3 results
```

**Step 3: Validate Results**
- File appears in top 3 results? ‚úÖ
- Correct section returned (not irrelevant section)? ‚úÖ
- Query efficiency: 1 query to find answer? ‚úÖ

**Step 4: Iterate if Needed**
- Not in top 3? Add more query hooks or improve keywords
- Wrong section returned? Improve section headers
- Too many queries needed? Add TL;DR or cross-references

---

### 2.4 Quality Gates

**Before marking file as "complete":**

```markdown
**Quality Checklist:**
- [ ] File score ‚â•8/10 (7/10 minimum, 8+ target)
- [ ] All 5 critical optimizations applied (if applicable)
- [ ] Test queries return file in top 3 results
- [ ] No markdown syntax errors
- [ ] No broken internal links
- [ ] Semantic meaning preserved (didn't change intent)
- [ ] Code examples still accurate
- [ ] Findings documented in Appendix A
```

**Red Flags (requires immediate attention):**
- Score decreased after optimization
- Test queries don't return file anymore
- Content changed meaning
- Introduced factual errors
- Broken links or formatting

---

## 3. Rollout Strategy

### 3.1 Phased Implementation Approach

**Phase 1: Pilot (Week 1)**
```bash
# Optimize 1 file with full documentation
1. Read: standards/architecture/solid-principles.md
2. Evaluate: Apply rubric, document baseline score
3. Optimize: Apply all 5 patterns with extra care
4. Validate: Test queries, re-score, document learnings
5. Iterate: Refine template based on results
```

**Why:** Validate approach before scaling, refine template

**Phase 2: High-Priority Batch (Week 2)**
```bash
# Optimize 4 more high-impact files
- standards/testing/test-pyramid.md
- standards/ai-safety/production-code-checklist.md
- standards/testing/integration-testing.md
- standards/architecture/api-design-principles.md

# Parallel work possible (if multiple authors)
```

**Why:** Improve most-queried files first, maximize impact

**Phase 3: Category-by-Category (Weeks 3-6)**
```bash
# Week 3: Usage guides (6 files)
# Week 4: Architecture + Testing (5 files)
# Week 5: Security + Database + Concurrency (8 files)
# Week 6: Meta-framework + Remaining (10 files)
```

**Why:** Batch similar content together, consistent approach per category

**Phase 4: Validation (Week 7)**
```bash
# Run comprehensive test suite
1. Execute 50 test queries
2. Measure success rate and efficiency
3. Identify any remaining gaps
4. Final polish on lowest-scoring files
```

**Why:** Data-driven validation, catch any missed optimizations

---

### 3.2 Git Workflow

**Branch Strategy:**
```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b rag-optimization/pilot-solid-principles

# After optimization and validation
git add universal/standards/architecture/solid-principles.md
git commit -m "optimize(rag): SOLID principles - TL;DR, query hooks, query-oriented headers

- Added comprehensive TL;DR (5 principles summary)
- Added 'Questions This Answers' section (10 questions)
- Converted headers to query-oriented format
- Added 'When to Query' section (7 scenarios)
- Added cross-references with example queries
- Score: 6/10 ‚Üí 9/10
- Test queries validated: 5/5 in top 3 results"

git push origin rag-optimization/pilot-solid-principles
```

**Pull Request Template:**
```markdown

---

### 3.3 Parallel Work Guidelines

**If multiple authors:**

**1. Assign by Category**
```
Author A: Architecture standards (5 files)
Author B: Testing standards (5 files)
Author C: Usage guides (6 files)
```

**2. Shared Resources**
- Template: Use same gold standard template
- Scoring: Use same rubric (consistency)
- Patterns: Update shared Appendix C (with coordination)
- Statistics: Update shared summary (with coordination)

**3. Coordination Points**
- Daily: Share any template refinements
- Weekly: Review each other's work (peer review)
- End of phase: Reconcile statistics and patterns

**4. Avoid Conflicts**
- Don't edit same file simultaneously
- Don't edit Appendix A simultaneously (use file locking or merge carefully)
- Coordinate Appendix C updates (one author adds patterns at a time)

---

### 3.4 Continuous Validation

**After every 5 files optimized:**
```bash
# 1. Update summary statistics
# Calculate: average score, distribution, category scores

# 2. Validate patterns
# Check: consistent application, no drift from template

# 3. Test sample queries
# Run: 10 random test queries from repository
# Verify: success rate increasing, query efficiency improving

# 4. Retrospective
# Document: what's working, what needs adjustment
```

**Red flags to watch for:**
- Scores plateauing or decreasing
- Inconsistent pattern application
- Test queries not improving
- Taking longer per file (should get faster with practice)

---

## 4. Troubleshooting Guide

### 4.1 Common Issue: File Score Not Improving

**Symptom:**
- Applied all 5 optimizations
- File still scores 6/10 or below
- Test queries don't return file

**Diagnosis:**
```markdown
**Check 1: Is TL;DR comprehensive?**
- Does it cover all key concepts?
- Is "When to query" section specific?
- Are questions representative?

**Check 2: Are headers truly query-oriented?**
- Do they match natural language queries?
- Are they specific (not generic like "Overview")?
- Do they include action verbs?

**Check 3: Is "When to Query" section specific?**
- Are scenarios concrete and relatable?
- Are queries realistic?
- Cover 4-7 scenarios?

**Check 4: Are cross-references relevant?**
- Do they link commonly-queried-together standards?
- Are example queries provided?
- Is query workflow clear?
```

**Solution:**
1. Compare against gold standard template (section by section)
2. Read file from AI agent perspective ("Would I find this with a natural query?")
3. Test with 5 different query phrasings
4. Iterate on headers and query hooks based on test results

---

### 4.2 Common Issue: Test Queries Not Returning File

**Symptom:**
- File optimized and scores 8/10
- Test queries don't return file in top 3 results
- Other files ranking higher

**Diagnosis:**
```markdown
**Check 1: Query terminology mismatch**
- AI agent queries: "how to test database"
- File uses: "database integration testing patterns"
- Solution: Add natural language variants in query hooks

**Check 2: Keyword density too low**
- File uses technical jargon exclusively
- AI agent queries use natural language
- Solution: Add natural language explanations

**Check 3: Competing content**
- Other files better optimized for same query
- Solution: Refine cross-references to create clear paths

**Check 4: Section headers not indexed well**
- Headers don't include key terms
- Solution: Enhance headers with query-oriented terms
```

**Solution:**
```bash
# 1. Analyze competing files
search_standards("your test query")
# ‚Üí See what ranks higher and why

# 2. Extract their patterns
# ‚Üí What headers do they use?
# ‚Üí What terminology?

# 3. Enhance your file
# ‚Üí Add missing terminology to query hooks
# ‚Üí Improve headers with better query terms
# ‚Üí Add TL;DR section if missing

# 4. Re-test
search_standards("your test query")
# ‚Üí Verify file now ranks in top 3
```

---

### 4.3 Common Issue: Optimization Changes File Meaning

**Symptom:**
- Headers changed to query-oriented
- Content meaning subtly shifted
- Technical accuracy compromised

**Diagnosis:**
```markdown
**Red Flag 1: Headers too question-focused**
- Before: "Liskov Substitution Principle"
- After: "Why Should Subtypes Replace Base Types?"
- Problem: Lost the term "Liskov Substitution"

**Red Flag 2: TL;DR over-simplifies**
- Original: "Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering correctness"
- TL;DR: "Child classes should work like parent classes"
- Problem: Technically incomplete

**Red Flag 3: Examples changed**
- Original: Precise technical example
- Optimized: Simplified but incorrect example
- Problem: Introduces errors
```

**Solution:**
1. **Keep original term in parentheses:**
   - ‚ùå "Why Should Subtypes Replace Base Types?"
   - ‚úÖ "Why Use Liskov Substitution Principle? (Subtype Substitutability)"

2. **TL;DR = summary, not simplification:**
   - ‚ùå "Child classes should work like parent classes" (too simple)
   - ‚úÖ "Subtypes must be substitutable for base types without altering program correctness" (accurate summary)

3. **Never change code examples:**
   - Optimization = structure and discoverability
   - Content accuracy = non-negotiable
   - If examples need fixing, that's separate work

---

### 4.4 Common Issue: Taking Too Long Per File

**Symptom:**
- First file: 3 hours ‚úÖ
- Fifth file: still 3 hours ‚ùå
- Should get faster with practice

**Diagnosis:**
```markdown
**Check 1: Re-reading template every time?**
- Should have template memorized after 2-3 files
- Solution: Create checklist, follow pattern

**Check 2: Over-thinking headers?**
- Spending 20+ minutes on headers
- Solution: Use transformation rules, don't over-optimize

**Check 3: Writing from scratch?**
- Not reusing patterns from previous files
- Solution: Use Appendix C patterns, copy-paste and adapt

**Check 4: Re-evaluating multiple times?**
- Scoring file 3+ times
- Solution: Score once before, once after, trust the rubric
```

**Solution - Optimization Checklist:**
```markdown
**Phase 1: Evaluate (10 minutes)**
- [ ] Read file completely (5-8 min)
- [ ] Apply rubric (2 min)
- [ ] Document baseline (1 min)

**Phase 2: Optimize (20-30 minutes)**
- [ ] Add TL;DR (use template, 5 min)
- [ ] Add query hooks (reuse question patterns, 5 min)
- [ ] Convert headers (transformation rules, 5 min)
- [ ] Add "When to Query" (reuse scenarios, 5 min)
- [ ] Add cross-references (lookup related files, 5 min)

**Phase 3: Validate (10 minutes)**
- [ ] Re-score (2 min)
- [ ] Test queries (5 min)
- [ ] Document findings (3 min)

**Total: 40-50 minutes per file**
```

**Use templates and patterns:**
- TL;DR structure: memorize it
- Query hook questions: reuse common ones ("What is X?", "When to use X?", "How to implement X?")
- "When to Query" scenarios: adapt from similar files
- Cross-references: maintain a "commonly linked standards" list

---

### 4.5 Common Issue: Inconsistent Pattern Application

**Symptom:**
- First 5 files: query hooks at top
- Next 5 files: query hooks after TL;DR
- Next 5 files: query hooks at bottom
- Inconsistency creates poor UX

**Diagnosis:**
```markdown
**Cause 1: Template drift**
- Started with one pattern
- Gradually changed approach
- Lost consistency

**Cause 2: Multiple authors without coordination**
- Each author interprets template differently
- No shared review

**Cause 3: No reference file**
- Relying on memory
- Forgetting exact structure
```

**Solution:**
```bash
# 1. Designate gold standard reference
# Always refer to: universal/standards/ai-assistant/MCP-TOOLS-GUIDE.md
# (Score: 9/10, exemplary structure)

# 2. Checklist enforcement
# Before optimizing each file:
- [ ] Opened gold standard reference? 
- [ ] Following exact section order?
- [ ] Using exact header format?

# 3. Peer review after every 5 files
# Another author reviews for consistency
# Fix any drift immediately

# 4. Update Appendix C with patterns
# Document exact format for each optimization
# Include "copy-paste ready" examples
```

**Standard Section Order:**
1. Title and description
2. TL;DR (if >150 lines)
3. "Questions This Answers" (query hooks)
4. Purpose
5. Main content (with query-oriented headers)
6. "When to Query This Standard" (query teaching)
7. Related Standards (cross-references)

---

### 4.6 Common Issue: RAG System Not Picking Up Changes

**Symptom:**
- File optimized and committed
- Test queries still return old results
- Changes not reflected in RAG system

**Diagnosis:**
```markdown
**Cause 1: RAG index not rebuilt**
- Optimizations saved to disk
- Vector DB still has old embeddings
- Solution: Rebuild RAG index

**Cause 2: Cache not cleared**
- RAG system caching previous results
- Solution: Clear cache

**Cause 3: Query doesn't match new terminology**
- Optimized file uses different terms
- Query still using old terms
- Solution: Try natural language variants
```

**Solution:**
```bash
# 1. Rebuild RAG index
cd /path/to/agent-os-enhanced
python scripts/build_rag_index.py

# Expected output:
# ‚úÖ Indexed 48 files
# ‚úÖ Vector database updated
# ‚úÖ Cache cleared

# 2. Verify with test query
search_standards("your test query")
# ‚Üí Should return newly optimized file

# 3. If still not working, check file path
# Verify file is in indexed directories:
# - universal/standards/
# - universal/usage/
# - universal/meta-workflow/ (if meta-workflow content indexed)
```

## 5. Best Practices Summary

### 5.1 Do's

‚úÖ **Read complete files** (don't skim or read partially)
‚úÖ **Use gold standard template consistently** (no improvising)
‚úÖ **Test with natural language queries** (how AI agents actually query)
‚úÖ **Document every evaluation** (Appendix A)
‚úÖ **Reuse patterns** (Appendix C)
‚úÖ **Validate with test queries** (before marking complete)
‚úÖ **Preserve semantic meaning** (accuracy over optimization)
‚úÖ **Keep original terminology** (add natural language, don't replace)
‚úÖ **Peer review high-priority files** (second set of eyes)
‚úÖ **Track statistics continuously** (catch issues early)

### 5.2 Don'ts

‚ùå **Don't optimize without evaluating first** (need baseline)
‚ùå **Don't change code examples** (only structure and discoverability)
‚ùå **Don't over-optimize** (readability still matters)
‚ùå **Don't skip validation** (test queries are mandatory)
‚ùå **Don't work on same file simultaneously** (merge conflicts)
‚ùå **Don't improvise structure** (follow template)
‚ùå **Don't simplify at cost of accuracy** (TL;DR = summary, not dumbing down)
‚ùå **Don't forget cross-references** (discoverability through navigation)
‚ùå **Don't assume improvement** (measure with scoring and queries)
‚ùå **Don't optimize files scoring 9-10** (don't break what works)

### 5.3 Optimization Mantras

1. **"Evaluate before optimizing"** - Always establish baseline
2. **"Test with natural queries"** - Match AI agent behavior
3. **"Consistency over creativity"** - Template adherence > improvisation
4. **"Measure, don't assume"** - Scoring and test queries validate
5. **"Preserve meaning, improve discoverability"** - Accuracy is non-negotiable
