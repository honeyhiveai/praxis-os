# Software Requirements Document

**Project:** RAG Content Optimization  
**Date:** 2025-10-10  
**Priority:** High  
**Category:** Enhancement

---

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document defines the requirements for optimizing Agent OS Enhanced content (standards, usage guides, meta-workflow documentation) for AI agent discoverability via semantic search (RAG system).

### 1.2 Scope
This feature will systematically apply RAG optimization principles to ~48 knowledge documents to improve semantic search discoverability, reduce query inefficiency, and enable self-reinforcing agent behavior through explicit query pattern teaching.

---

## 2. Business Goals

### Goal 1: Maximize Content Discoverability

**Objective:** Ensure AI agents can reliably discover relevant content through natural language queries

**Success Metrics:**
- **Query success rate**: <50% (estimated baseline) → 90%+ (target)
- **Top-3 ranking**: Relevant content appears in top 3 results 90%+ of the time
- **Query test suite**: 50 natural language queries with validated success rates

**Business Impact:**
- AI agents spend less time searching, more time implementing
- Reduced context window waste from failed queries
- Improved autonomous task completion rates
- Better developer experience for Agent OS Enhanced users

---

### Goal 2: Reduce Query Inefficiency

**Objective:** Reduce the number of queries required to find complete answers

**Success Metrics:**
- **Queries per answer**: 3-4 queries (baseline) → 1-2 queries (target)
- **Average query latency**: Reduced by 50% through better first-hit accuracy
- **Context window efficiency**: 30-40% reduction in RAG-related token usage

**Business Impact:**
- Faster task completion times
- Lower computational costs (fewer embedding queries)
- Reduced context window consumption
- More efficient AI agent workflows

---

### Goal 3: Enable Self-Reinforcing Query Behavior

**Objective:** Teach AI agents when and how to query standards through embedded patterns

**Success Metrics:**
- **Query pattern coverage**: 0% of standards teach querying → 100% teach explicit patterns
- **Cross-reference coverage**: Standards link to related queries 100% of the time
- **Query hook adoption**: "Questions This Answers" sections in 100% of standards

**Business Impact:**
- AI agents learn optimal query habits organically
- Sustainable behavior patterns without manual retraining
- Improved long-term system performance
- Reduced dependency on external prompting

---

### Goal 4: Ensure Consistency Across Standards

**Objective:** Apply unified RAG optimization framework to all knowledge documents

**Success Metrics:**
- **Standards evaluated**: 0 files → 48 files (100%)
- **Average quality score**: 7.6/10 (baseline, 20 files) → 8.5+/10 (target)
- **Score distribution**: 15% exemplary, 75% good, 10% adequate → 60% exemplary, 40% good, 0% adequate

**Business Impact:**
- Predictable content quality across all standards
- Easier maintenance and updates
- Consistent developer experience
- Scalable content authoring process

---

## 2.1 Supporting Documentation

The business goals above are informed by:
- **DESIGN-DOC-RAG-Content-Optimization.md**: Comprehensive analysis of 20 files with detailed findings, patterns, and recommendations

See `supporting-docs/` for complete analysis and evaluation framework.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR-1: Performance - Query Response Time
**Description:** Semantic search queries must return results within acceptable time limits

**Requirements:**
- Vector search latency: <100ms for simple queries
- Complex queries: <200ms with multiple filters
- Index rebuild: <5 minutes for full corpus
- Incremental updates: <30 seconds

**Rationale:** Fast query response times are critical for AI agent workflows and user experience

---

### NFR-2: Maintainability - Content Updates
**Description:** Optimized content must be easy to maintain and update

**Requirements:**
- Template-based structure for consistency
- Reusable patterns documented in Appendix C
- Clear guidelines for future content authors
- Optimization can be applied incrementally

**Rationale:** Content will evolve; optimizations must not create maintenance burden

---

### NFR-3: Compatibility - Existing RAG System
**Description:** Optimizations must work with existing RAG infrastructure without breaking changes

**Requirements:**
- No changes to RAG engine required
- Works with current chunking strategy (100-500 tokens)
- Compatible with existing vector embeddings
- No migration of historical content required

**Rationale:** Infrastructure changes are costly; leverage existing system

---

### NFR-4: Scalability - Future Content Growth
**Description:** Optimization framework must scale to additional content

**Requirements:**
- Framework applies to new standards without modification
- Scoring rubric scales to any content type
- Test query suite can grow beyond 50 queries
- Works for corpus size 50-500 documents

**Rationale:** Agent OS will grow; framework must accommodate expansion

---

### NFR-5: Measurability - Success Validation
**Description:** Improvements must be objectively measurable

**Requirements:**
- Query success rate calculable (% in top 3 results)
- Query efficiency measurable (queries per answer)
- Score distribution trackable over time
- A/B testing possible (before/after comparison)

**Rationale:** Can't improve what we can't measure

---

### NFR-6: Usability - Content Author Experience
**Description:** Content authors must find optimization guidelines clear and actionable

**Requirements:**
- Gold standard template is self-explanatory
- Checklist items are binary (yes/no)
- Examples demonstrate each optimization
- Scoring rubric is objective

**Rationale:** Adoption depends on clarity and ease of use

---

### NFR-7: Quality - Consistency Across Content
**Description:** All optimized content must meet minimum quality standards

**Requirements:**
- No files below 7/10 score
- Average score ≥8.5/10
- 60%+ files score 9-10/10 (exemplary)
- Standard deviation in scores <1.5

**Rationale:** Inconsistent quality degrades user experience

---

## 6. Out of Scope

This section explicitly states what will NOT be included in this feature to prevent scope creep.

### NOT INCLUDED: Workflow Execution Files
**Rationale:** Workflow `phase.md` and `task-*.md` files are optimized for linear reading and execution, not RAG queries. These files are only indexed for workflow existence awareness. Only knowledge documents (standards, usage, meta-workflow) are RAG-optimized.

---

### NOT INCLUDED: RAG Engine Modifications
**Rationale:** This project optimizes content only. No changes to the RAG engine, vector embeddings, chunking strategy, or search algorithms. We work within existing infrastructure constraints.

---

### NOT INCLUDED: Language-Specific Standards
**Rationale:** Focus is on universal standards. Language-specific implementations (e.g., python-testing.md, go-concurrency.md) are referenced but not optimized in Phase 1. Future iterations may expand scope.

---

### NOT INCLUDED: Supporting Documentation
**Rationale:** Design documents, analysis files, and temporary artifacts are not RAG-optimized. Only canonical standards that ship with Agent OS installations are in scope.

---

### NOT INCLUDED: Automated Optimization Tools
**Rationale:** Optimization will be manual/semi-automated. Fully automated content generation tools are not in scope. Focus is on establishing framework and patterns first.

---

### NOT INCLUDED: Historical Content Migration
**Rationale:** Existing optimized content (rag-content-authoring.md, MCP-TOOLS-GUIDE.md) will not be retroactively modified unless they need updates. Focus is on improving sub-optimal content.

---

### NOT INCLUDED: Real-Time Query Analytics
**Rationale:** While test queries will validate improvements, real-time production query logging and analytics are not in scope. Validation uses predetermined test suites only.

---

### NOT INCLUDED: Multi-Language Content
**Rationale:** All content is English only. Internationalization and multi-language RAG optimization are explicitly out of scope.

---

### NOT INCLUDED: External Documentation
**Rationale:** Third-party documentation, external links, and reference materials are not modified. Only content owned and maintained by Agent OS Enhanced is optimized.

---

### NOT INCLUDED: UI/UX Changes
**Rationale:** No changes to Cursor IDE, MCP tools interface, or any user-facing applications. Pure content optimization only.
