## Risk Mitigation

### Risk: Optimization takes longer than estimated
**Mitigation:** 
- Pilot (Task 1.1) validates estimates
- Template refinement reduces future task time
- Tasks can be parallelized (multiple authors)

### Risk: Files don't reach target scores
**Mitigation:**
- Iterate on template based on results
- Additional optimization pass if needed
- Quality gates prevent advancement until met

### Risk: Query tests don't show improvement
**Mitigation:**
- Test early (after Phase 1)
- Adjust optimization approach if needed
- Additional query patterns if initial approach insufficient
