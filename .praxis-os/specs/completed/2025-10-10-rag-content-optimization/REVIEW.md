   - Use Appendix C patterns
   - Peer review every 5 files

3. **Measure Continuously**
   - Update summary statistics after every 5 files
   - Run test queries periodically
   - Track time per file (should decrease)

4. **Iterate as Needed**
   - Refine template based on pilot results
   - Adjust approach if patterns emerge
   - Don't be afraid to revisit earlier files
