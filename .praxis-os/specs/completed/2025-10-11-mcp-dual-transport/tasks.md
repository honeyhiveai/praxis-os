## Dependencies

### Phase 1 → Phase 2
Phase 2 (Testing) depends on Phase 1 (Implementation) being complete.
Cannot write tests without implemented components.

### Phase 2 → Phase 3
Phase 3 (Documentation) depends on Phase 2 (Testing) passing.
Cannot document features without validation they work correctly.

### Phase 3 → Phase 4
Phase 4 (Rollout) depends on Phase 3 (Documentation) being complete.
Cannot release without comprehensive documentation.

### Task-Level Dependencies

- **Task 1.4** (Entry Point) depends on Tasks 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 (PortManager, ProjectInfoDiscovery, TransportManager)
- **Task 1.6** (get_server_info tool) depends on Task 1.2 (ProjectInfoDiscovery)
- **Task 2.1, 2.2, 2.3** (Unit tests) can run in parallel
- **Task 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7** (Integration tests) depend on Task 1.4 (Entry Point complete)
- **Task 3.1** (Discovery utility) depends on Task 1.1 (PortManager for state file format)
- **Task 3.2** (Example client) depends on Task 3.1 (Discovery utility)
- **Task 4.1** (Pre-merge validation) depends on ALL previous phases

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk: Thread Safety Issues in Shared Components
**Likelihood:** Medium  
**Impact:** High (data corruption, crashes)  
**Mitigation:**
- Add threading locks to RAGEngine and WorkflowEngine (Task 1.3)
- Comprehensive thread safety tests (Task 2.7)
- Load testing with concurrent requests
- Code review focused on thread safety

### Risk: Port Exhaustion in Development
**Likelihood:** Low  
**Impact:** Medium (server won't start)  
**Mitigation:**
- Large port range (1000 ports: 4242-5242)
- Clear error message with remediation steps (Task 1.1)
- Documentation on how to close servers (Task 3.6)

### Risk: State File Corruption
**Likelihood:** Low  
**Impact:** Medium (sub-agents can't connect)  
**Mitigation:**
- Atomic write (temp + rename) (Task 1.1)
- State file validation in `read_state()` (Task 1.1)
- Graceful fallback to None on corruption (Task 2.6)

### Risk: Git Command Failures
**Likelihood:** Medium  
**Impact:** Low (falls back to directory name)  
**Mitigation:**
- Subprocess timeout (5s) (Task 1.2)
- Graceful fallback to directory name (Task 1.2)
- Error handling for all git commands (Task 1.2)

### Risk: Backward Compatibility Break
**Likelihood:** Low  
**Impact:** High (existing users affected)  
**Mitigation:**
- stdio-only mode preserved (Task 1.4)
- Explicit --transport flag prevents accidental changes
- Comprehensive testing of stdio-only mode (Task 2.4)
- Documentation emphasizes opt-in nature (Task 3.4)

---

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests (Phase 2, Tasks 2.1-2.3)
- **PortManager:** Port allocation, state file operations, permissions
- **ProjectInfoDiscovery:** Project name extraction, git info, fallbacks
- **TransportManager:** Thread creation, readiness checks, timeouts
- **Coverage Target:** ≥ 80% for all new components
- **Tools:** pytest, pytest-cov, unittest.mock

### Integration Tests (Phase 2, Tasks 2.4-2.7)
- **Dual Transport:** End-to-end stdio + HTTP serving
- **Multi-Project:** 3+ servers without conflicts
- **Error Scenarios:** Port exhaustion, stale state, crashes
- **Thread Safety:** Concurrent requests from both transports
- **Tools:** pytest, MCP SDK client, subprocess

### Manual Testing (Phase 4, Task 4.1)
- Test in Cursor with dual transport mode
- Test with 3 concurrent Cursor windows
- Test example sub-agent connection
- Verify documentation accuracy
