## Document Catalog

### 1. DESIGN-DOC-MCP-Dual-Transport.md

**File:** `DESIGN-DOC-MCP-Dual-Transport.md`  
**Type:** Comprehensive Design Document  
**Purpose:** Complete architectural design for implementing dual-transport (stdio + HTTP) support in Agent OS MCP server, including validation results proving feasibility.

**Relevance:** Requirements [H], Design [H], Implementation [H]

**Key Topics:**
- Dual-transport architecture (stdio for IDE, HTTP for sub-agents)
- Automatic port allocation and conflict resolution
- Project isolation and multi-project support
- State file management for sub-agent discovery
- Dynamic project information discovery
- Thread-safe concurrent transport orchestration
- Port management (4242-5242 range)
- Transport modes (dual, stdio-only, HTTP-only)
- Sub-agent integration patterns
- Security considerations (localhost-only binding)
- Testing strategy and validation
- Migration path and rollout plan

## Cross-Document Analysis

**Common Themes:**
- Complete isolation between projects (ports, state, RAG indices)
- Automatic conflict resolution through port allocation
- Zero-configuration discovery for sub-agents
- Thread-based concurrent transport handling
- Validated architecture with working proof-of-concept code

**Potential Conflicts:**
- None - single authoritative design document

**Coverage Gaps:**
- Implementation-specific code patterns (to be derived during implementation)
- Specific test cases for edge scenarios (to be developed in testing phase)
- Performance benchmarks under load (deferred to post-implementation)

## Next Steps

This index will be used in Task 3 to systematically extract insights from the document. The extracted insights will be organized by:
- **Requirements Insights:** User needs, business goals, functional requirements
- **Design Insights:** Architecture patterns, technical approaches, component designs
- **Implementation Insights:** Code patterns, testing strategies, deployment guidance
