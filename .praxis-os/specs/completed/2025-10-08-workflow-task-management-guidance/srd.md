# Software Requirements Document

**Project:** Workflow Task Management Guidance  
**Date:** 2025-10-08  
**Priority:** High  
**Category:** Enhancement

---

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document defines the requirements for adding explicit task management guidance to Agent OS MCP workflow tool responses to prevent AI from creating parallel TODO lists during workflow execution.

### 1.2 Scope
This feature will inject standardized guidance into all MCP workflow tool responses (`start_workflow`, `get_current_phase`, `get_task`, `complete_phase`) indicating that the workflow system manages tasks and external task tools should not be used.

---

## 2. Business Goals

### Goal 1: Enforce Single-Source-of-Truth for Task Management

**Objective:** Eliminate AI-created parallel task tracking systems during workflow execution by making workflow system's role as task manager explicit in every tool response.

**Success Metrics:**
- **Parallel TODO creation rate**: 100% (current) ‚Üí 0% (target)
- **Workflow execution consistency**: Variable (current) ‚Üí 100% workflow-managed (target)
- **AI confusion incidents**: 1+ per workflow execution (current) ‚Üí 0 (target)

**Business Impact:**
- **Users benefit**: Clearer workflow execution model, predictable AI behavior
- **Developers benefit**: Single task state to monitor and debug
- **System benefit**: Reduced complexity, fewer competing state management systems
- **Expected value**: Improved workflow reliability and user trust in guided execution patterns

### Goal 2: Maximize Workflow System Adoption

**Objective:** Increase confidence that workflows provide complete guidance by demonstrating clear ownership of task management lifecycle.

**Success Metrics:**
- **Workflow execution compliance**: Variable (current) ‚Üí 100% (target)
- **User trust in workflow system**: Unknown (current) ‚Üí Measurable increase through dogfooding feedback (target)

**Business Impact:**
- **Agent OS adoption**: More reliable workflows ‚Üí increased user adoption
- **Dogfooding success**: Internal teams can confidently use workflows for complex tasks
- **Meta-framework validation**: Demonstrates workflows as complete, self-contained execution systems

---

## 2.1 Supporting Documentation

The business goals above are informed by:
- **problem-analysis.md**: Identified architectural constraint (cannot modify Cursor tools), root cause (missing guidance in MCP responses), and business impact (single-source-of-truth violation)
- **problem-analysis.md**: Extracted user need for AI to understand workflow system manages tasks
- **problem-analysis.md**: Documented importance of consistency in workflow execution patterns

See `supporting-docs/INDEX.md` for complete analysis with 26 extracted insights.

## 3. User Stories

User stories describe the feature from the user's perspective.

### Story Format

**As a** {user type}  
**I want to** {capability}  
**So that** {benefit}

---

### Story 1: AI Assistant Receives Clear Task Management Guidance

**As an** AI assistant executing an Agent OS workflow  
**I want to** receive explicit guidance in every workflow tool response that the workflow system manages all tasks  
**So that** I don't create parallel TODO lists and maintain single-source-of-truth for task state

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I call `start_workflow()`, `get_current_phase()`, `get_task()`, or `complete_phase()`
- When the MCP server returns the response
- Then the response includes explicit fields indicating workflow-managed task execution mode
- And the response explicitly prohibits using external task tools like `todo_write`

**Priority:** Critical

---

### Story 2: Human User Monitors Single Task State

**As a** human user monitoring workflow execution  
**I want to** have a single source of truth for task progress and state  
**So that** I can clearly understand workflow progress without reconciling multiple task tracking systems

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given a workflow is executing
- When I check workflow state via `get_workflow_state()`
- Then all task status information comes from workflow system only
- And no parallel TODO lists exist to cause confusion

**Priority:** Critical

---

### Story 3: Developer Debugs Workflow Behavior

**As a** developer debugging workflow execution issues  
**I want to** see consistent workflow execution patterns without external task management  
**So that** I can identify issues in workflow design rather than AI task management choices

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I'm reviewing workflow execution logs
- When I examine task progression
- Then all task state transitions are tracked solely through workflow checkpoints
- And no external TODO operations interfere with workflow flow

**Priority:** High

---

### Story 4: Workflow System Signals Operating Mode

**As the** Agent OS workflow system  
**I want to** clearly communicate my role as the task manager for active sessions  
**So that** AI assistants understand they should delegate task management to me

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given a workflow session is active
- When any workflow tool is invoked
- Then the response includes task management mode indicator
- And guidance persists across all tool calls (not just `start_workflow`)

**Priority:** Critical

---

## 6. Out of Scope

Explicitly defines what is NOT included. Items may be considered for future phases.

### Explicitly Excluded

#### Features

**Not Included in This Release:**

1. **Modifying Cursor's todo_write Tool Description**
   - **Reason:** Architectural constraint - we cannot modify Cursor's built-in tools
   - **Future Consideration:** Could request Cursor add workflow awareness to their tools (not within our control)

2. **Visual UI for Workflow Task Management**
   - **Reason:** Focus is on AI-facing guidance, not human UI
   - **Future Consideration:** Could add dashboard showing workflow task state in future release

3. **Retroactive Application to Active Workflows**
   - **Reason:** Only applies to new workflow tool calls after deployment
   - **Future Consideration:** Not applicable - workflows in progress will complete with old behavior

4. **Custom Guidance Per Workflow Type**
   - **Reason:** Universal guidance simpler and more maintainable
   - **Future Consideration:** Could add workflow-specific messaging if needed, but not currently required

5. **Analytics on TODO Creation Prevention**
   - **Reason:** Out of scope for initial implementation - validation is manual/test-based
   - **Future Consideration:** Could add telemetry to track effectiveness

6. **Guidance Localization/Translation**
   - **Reason:** English-only for initial release
   - **Future Consideration:** If Agent OS adds i18n support, guidance could be localized

---

#### Platforms

**Not Supported:**
- Only applies to MCP-based workflow execution
- Does not affect non-workflow tool usage
- Does not affect workflows executed outside MCP context (if any exist)

---

#### Integration

**Not Integrated:**
- No changes to Cursor IDE behavior
- No changes to other MCP servers
- No changes to workflow markdown content

---

#### Quality Levels

**Not Required:**
- Sub-millisecond injection performance (< 1ms is sufficient per NFR-P1)
- Telemetry/observability of guidance effectiveness (manual validation only)
- A/B testing different guidance messages
- Machine learning to optimize guidance text

---

#### Compliance/Standards

**Not Applicable:**
- No security/privacy implications (guidance is advisory text)
- No accessibility requirements (AI-facing, not human UI)
- No regulatory compliance requirements

---

## 6.1 Future Phase Candidates

**Version 2.0 Enhancements:**
- Workflow-specific guidance customization
- Telemetry tracking guidance effectiveness
