# Workflow Task Management Guidance - Specification Package

**Date:** 2025-10-08  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Status:** Complete - Ready for Implementation

---

## 📋 Specification Overview

This specification addresses the issue of AI assistants creating parallel TODO lists while executing MCP workflows, violating the single-source-of-truth principle. The solution injects explicit task management guidance into all workflow tool responses.

**Key Innovation:** Response wrapper pattern that adds guidance fields to all MCP workflow responses without modifying workflow content files.
