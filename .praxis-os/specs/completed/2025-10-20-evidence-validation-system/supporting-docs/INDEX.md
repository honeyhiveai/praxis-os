### 1. Evidence Validation System - Design Document

**File:** `evidence-validation-system-2025-10-20.md`  
**Type:** Comprehensive Design Document  
**Purpose:** Complete technical design for fixing the critical evidence validation bug in the workflow engine and implementing config-driven gate definitions

**Relevance:** Requirements [H], Design [H], Implementation [H]

**Key Topics:**
- Critical bug in `mcp_server/core/session.py:503` (hardcoded validation bypass)
- gate-definition.yaml format and structure
- CheckpointLoader enhancement for YAML loading
- Migration strategy for existing workflows
- Information asymmetry design (hiding schemas from AI)
- Proof-based evidence requirements
- 3-week implementation timeline

**Document Structure:**
- Executive Summary (problem, solution, timeline)
- Problem Statement (the bug, real-world example, architecture gap)
- Goals & Non-Goals
- Detailed Design (3 components: Enable Validation, Gate Definitions, Workflow Updates)
- Implementation Plan (weekly breakdown)
- Testing Strategy (unit + integration tests)
- Risk Analysis & Mitigations
- Success Metrics
- Dependencies
- Future Enhancements
- Appendices (templates, validator patterns, migration script)

**Critical Insights:**
- Validation system fully implemented but disabled
- Single 1-line fix enables validation immediately
- Gate definitions must be hidden from AI to prevent gaming
- Proof artifacts required, not just boolean claims
- Progressive strictness (lenient → strict across phases)

## Cross-Document Analysis

**Common Themes:**
- Security through information asymmetry (AI never sees schemas)
- Evidence-based validation (proof over claims)
- Backwards compatibility (fallback to permissive gates)
- Systematic approach (3-week phased rollout)

**Potential Conflicts:**
- None (single authoritative design document)

**Coverage Gaps:**
- None for initial implementation
- Future enhancements documented in design (async validation, audit trail)

**Design Completeness:**
- ✅ Problem clearly defined with real-world example
- ✅ Technical solution specified in detail
- ✅ Implementation plan with timeline
- ✅ Testing strategy defined
- ✅ Risk analysis with mitigations
- ✅ Code examples and templates provided
- ✅ Migration path for existing workflows

## Next Steps

This index will be used in Task 3 to systematically extract insights from the design document. The extracted insights will be organized by:

- **Requirements Insights:** 
  - Bug fix (enable validation)
  - Prevent false evidence submission
  - Hide schemas from AI
  - Retrofit existing workflows
  - Auto-generate gates going forward

- **Design Insights:** 
  - gate-definition.yaml structure
  - CheckpointLoader enhancement
  - Information asymmetry principle
  - Proof-based evidence
  - Progressive strictness model

- **Implementation Insights:** 
  - Session.py fix (line 503)
  - Migration script for existing workflows
  - Workflow_creation_v1 updates
  - Testing approach
  - Phased rollout strategy

## Extracted Insights

### Requirements Insights (Phase 1)

#### From Evidence Validation System Design Document:
- **Critical Bug Fix:** Enable validation system currently disabled by hardcoded `True` at `mcp_server/core/session.py:503`
- **Prevent False Evidence:** AI agents must not be able to submit false evidence claims and advance phases without verification
- **Hide Schemas from AI:** gate-definition.yaml must be hidden from AI to prevent gaming the system
- **Retrofit Existing Workflows:** All current workflows need gate-definition.yaml files added
- **Auto-generate Gates:** workflow_creation_v1 must generate gates automatically for future workflows
- **Proof-Based Evidence:** Replace boolean-only evidence with structured proof artifacts
- **Progressive Strictness:** Lenient gates for early phases, strict for implementation/validation phases
- **Backwards Compatibility:** System must fallback to permissive gates if no gate-definition.yaml found

### Design Insights (Phase 2)

#### From Evidence Validation System Design Document:
- **gate-definition.yaml Structure:** YAML format with checkpoint, evidence_schema, validators, cross_field_validation sections
- **Information Asymmetry Principle:** AI sees natural language in tasks, system knows hidden schema - prevents gaming
- **CheckpointLoader Enhancement:** Load from YAML first, fallback to RAG parsing, finally permissive gate
- **Validator System:** Lambda functions with error messages, parameterizable, reusable across workflows
- **Evidence Schema Fields:** type, required, validator, validator_params, description for each field
- **Strictness Levels:** strict (true/false), allow_override (true/false) configurable per phase
- **Proof Artifact Validation:** Validators check content of proof (not just presence) - e.g., yaml_content must parse, validation_output must contain success markers
- **Multi-Layer Defense:** Unknown field names + unknown types + unknown validators + proof content validation

### Implementation Insights (Phase 4)

#### From Evidence Validation System Design Document:
- **Immediate Fix:** Replace `checkpoint_passed=True` with call to `self.engine._validate_checkpoint(workflow_type, phase, evidence)`
- **Error Response Structure:** Return checkpoint_passed=False, errors array, diagnostics dict, remediation string, next_steps array
- **Migration Script:** `scripts/generate-gate-definitions.py` - scans workflows, parses checkpoints, generates YAML, supports dry-run
- **Workflow_creation_v1 Updates:** Add task-4-generate-gate-definitions.md and task-5-validate-gate-consistency.md to Phase 2
- **Testing Strategy:** Unit tests for validation, integration tests for complete_phase, test with real/fake evidence
- **Phased Rollout:** Week 1 (enable + bootstrap), Week 2 (enhance workflow_creation_v1), Week 3 (production ready)
- **Validator Patterns:** Common validators for string (non_empty, contains_any, matches_pattern), integer (positive, in_range, equals), object (has_fields, valid_structure)
- **Cache Strategy:** CheckpointLoader uses double-checked locking, caches parsed gate definitions for performance

### Cross-References

**Validated by Multiple Sources:** 
- Information asymmetry as core security principle (mentioned in Executive Summary, Design Overview, gate-definition format)
- Proof-based evidence requirement (mentioned in Goals, Design Principles, Evidence Schema examples)
- Three-week timeline (mentioned in Executive Summary, Implementation Plan)

**Conflicts:** None - single authoritative design document

**High-Priority:** 
- **P0:** Enable validation (1-line fix) - CRITICAL
- **P0:** Migration script for existing workflows - BLOCKS all workflows
- **P1:** gate-definition.yaml for workflow_creation_v1 Phase 0 - NEEDED for testing
- **P1:** Unit + integration tests - QUALITY GATE
