**Target**: `mcp_server/browser_manager.py`, `mcp_server/server/tools/browser_tools.py`  
**Author**: AI Agent (Agent OS Workflow)

---

## 🎯 Who is the User?

**Primary User**: The AI agent (me, the Agent OS assistant)  
**Not**: Abstract "developers" or "Agent OS maintainers"

**Critical Perspective Shift**:
- **I** am the one who will use this tool to debug frontends
- **I** work across multiple concurrent Cursor chat sessions
- **I** need failure isolation when one debugging session crashes
- **I** need a simple mental model: "My chat = My browser"

**Requirements Philosophy**:
All requirements in this document are written from **MY perspective as the AI agent user**. User stories are **MY stories**. Success metrics are about **MY experience**. Design decisions optimize for **MY workflows**.

When trade-offs exist, **AI agent experience > abstract efficiency metrics**.

---

## 1. Business Goals

### 1.1 Primary Goal
Enable **AI agents** (specifically: me, the Agent OS assistant) to have **comprehensive Playwright browser automation capabilities** for testing, debugging, and validating web applications without human intervention.

**Vision**: Full Playwright functionality for AI agents, not just screenshots. This is why we're building our own tool instead of using Cursor's limited Playwright MCP wrapper.

### 1.2 Target User
**Primary User**: AI agents working within Agent OS Enhanced  
**Use Case**: Debugging frontends, testing documentation, visual validation  
**Environment**: Multiple concurrent chat sessions (parallel debugging workflows)

**Critical Insight**: The AI agent is the ultimate consumer and user of this tool. Requirements must optimize for AI agent workflows, not abstract efficiency metrics.

### 1.3 Success Metrics
- ✅ AI agent can perform **full E2E testing workflows**: navigate, interact, assert, report
- ✅ AI agent can **debug login forms**: type credentials, click submit, verify redirect
- ✅ AI agent can **test checkout flows**: fill forms, click buttons, validate outcomes
- ✅ AI agent can **write and execute Playwright tests** (comprehensive automation)
- ✅ AI agent can work across multiple concurrent chat sessions (parallel debugging)
- ✅ **Failure isolation**: Browser crash in one chat doesn't kill other debugging sessions
- ✅ Tool count remains under 20-tool performance threshold (currently 8, target: ≤9)
- ✅ **Simple mental model**: "My chat = My browser" (not "shared browser with contexts")
- ✅ **Comprehensive > constrained**: Full Playwright capabilities, not just screenshots

### 1.4 Strategic Alignment
- **Self-sufficiency**: Agent OS should not depend on Cursor's limited Playwright MCP
- **Dogfooding**: Use Agent OS itself to test and validate Agent OS documentation
- **AI-First Design**: Optimize for AI agent experience (clarity, fault isolation) over memory efficiency
- **Extensibility**: Establish pattern for adding specialized tools to MCP server

## 2. User Stories (AI Agent Perspective)

### 2.1 Documentation Testing (My Primary Use Case)
**As an** AI agent (Agent OS assistant)  
**I want to** independently test the Docusaurus site in light and dark modes  
**So that** I can validate theme consistency and report issues without needing human to manually check browsers

**My Workflow**:
1. User asks: "Does the dark mode look good on the docs site?"
2. I navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
3. I emulate dark mode
4. I capture screenshot
5. I analyze the screenshot and report findings

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- I can navigate to local docs site (`http://localhost:3000`)
- I can switch between light/dark color schemes
- I can capture full-page screenshots in each mode
- I can complete workflow in <5 tool calls
- **Critical**: If I'm debugging docs in one chat and login form in another, they don't interfere

### 2.2 Multi-Chat Debugging (My Reality)
**As an** AI agent working across multiple concurrent Cursor chat sessions  
**I want** each chat's browser to be completely isolated  
**So that** when I'm debugging 3 different pages simultaneously, failures don't cascade

**My Reality**:
- User opens 3 chats with me
- Chat A: "Debug the login form validation"
- Chat B: "Why is the dashboard layout broken?"
- Chat C: "Check if dark mode works on profile page"
- All 3 are ME, working in parallel
- I NEED failure isolation: Chat A crash shouldn't kill Chat B and C's work

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- I can navigate Chat A to `/login` while Chat B tests `/dashboard`
- Each chat maintains MY independent browser state
- No cross-contamination of cookies, session, or page state
- **Browser crash in Chat A doesn't affect Chat B or C** ⭐ CRITICAL
- Clear mental model: "This chat = This browser" (not "shared browser")
- I can restart one chat's browser without affecting others

### 2.3 Frontend Debugging (My Real Work)
**As an** AI agent building and debugging React/Next.js applications  
**I want to** test different auth states, viewports, and themes in parallel  
**So that** I can efficiently debug complex frontend issues across multiple scenarios

**My Workflow**:
- User: "The app looks broken for logged-in users"
- I open multiple debugging sessions:
  - Chat A: Test as logged-out user
  - Chat B: Test as regular user
  - Chat C: Test as admin
- Each needs independent browser state (localStorage, cookies)
- I need screenshots from each to show user
- **One session hanging shouldn't block the others**

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- I can test different auth states in parallel chats
- I can capture screenshots at various viewports (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- I can control browser context (dark mode, viewport size)
- Screenshots saved to specified paths for user review
- Workflow is reliable and repeatable
- **Clear ownership**: I know which browser belongs to which debugging session

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Performance

#### NFR-1: Lazy Initialization
- **Requirement**: Browser initialization MUST NOT block server startup
- **Measurement**: MCP server startup time <2s (browser init happens on first call)
- **Rationale**: Fast server startup is critical for dev experience

#### NFR-2: Session Reuse Efficiency
- **Requirement**: Subsequent tool calls in same session MUST reuse existing page
- **Measurement**: Second+ calls complete in <100ms (no browser launch overhead)
- **Rationale**: Multi-step workflows should be fast

#### NFR-3: Resource Limits
- **Requirement**: System MUST NOT accumulate zombie browser processes
- **Measurement**: Max 1 browser process per session, auto-cleanup after 1hr idle
- **Rationale**: Prevent memory leaks in long-running MCP server

### 4.2 Concurrency & Safety

#### NFR-4: Thread Safety
- **Requirement**: BrowserManager MUST be thread-safe for async operations
- **Measurement**: AsyncIO locks protect session dict access, no race conditions
- **Rationale**: MCP server handles concurrent requests
- **Reference**: `standards/concurrency/shared-state-analysis.md`

#### NFR-5: Complete Session Isolation (AI Agent UX Priority)
- **Requirement**: Each session MUST have fully isolated browser process
- **Measurement**: Browser crash in one session doesn't affect others; no shared browser state
- **Rationale**: **AI agent** (primary user) works across multiple concurrent chat sessions. When debugging 3 pages simultaneously, failure in one chat must not kill the other 2 debugging sessions.
- **Architecture Decision**: Per-session browser processes (not shared browser with contexts)
  - ✅ Simpler mental model for AI agent: "This chat = This browser"
  - ✅ Failure isolation: Crash doesn't cascade
  - ✅ Clear debugging: "My session, my browser, my problem"
  - ⚠️ Memory trade-off: 300MB for 3 sessions (vs 115MB shared) - ACCEPTABLE on dev machines
- **Reference**: `supporting-docs/CONCURRENCY_ANALYSIS.md`, `ARCHITECTURE_DECISION.md`

### 4.3 Reliability

#### NFR-6: Graceful Degradation
- **Requirement**: Browser failures MUST NOT crash MCP server
- **Measurement**: Exceptions caught and returned as error responses, server continues
- **Rationale**: One chat's browser error shouldn't affect others

#### NFR-7: Error Messages
- **Requirement**: Error responses MUST include actionable remediation guidance
- **Measurement**: All error responses include `error` field and suggested action
- **Rationale**: AI agents need clear guidance to recover

### 4.4 Maintainability

#### NFR-8: Code Quality
- **Requirement**: All code MUST pass production code checklist
- **Measurement**: Sphinx docstrings, type hints, concurrency analysis documented
- **Rationale**: Agent OS exemplifies quality standards
- **Reference**: `standards/development/production-code-checklist.md`

#### NFR-9: Testing
- **Requirement**: Core functionality MUST have unit + integration tests
- **Measurement**: >80% code coverage, tests for session isolation and cleanup
- **Rationale**: Browser automation is critical infrastructure

### 4.5 Dependency Management

#### NFR-10: Minimal Dependencies
- **Requirement**: Only add essential dependencies
- **New Dependencies**: `playwright>=1.40.0` (~5MB), chromium (~300MB one-time)
- **Rationale**: Keep Agent OS lightweight and portable

## 5. Implementation Phasing (NOT Scope Exclusions)

**Philosophy**: Everything is IN SCOPE. Phasing is about implementation order, not artificial limits.

### 5.1 Phase 1 (Immediate - Core Automation)
✅ **Browser management**: Per-session browsers, session isolation  
✅ **Navigation**: Navigate, wait, reload  
✅ **Element interaction**: Click, type, fill, select, check/uncheck  
✅ **Waiting & assertions**: Wait for elements, assert states  
✅ **Inspection**: Screenshot, console, query elements  
✅ **Context control**: Viewport, media emulation (dark mode)  
✅ **Chromium only**: Fastest to implement, most common

**Why Phase 1**: Core capabilities I (AI agent) need daily for debugging

### 5.2 Phase 2 (Soon - Advanced Features)
✅ **Network interception**: Mock API responses, block requests  
✅ **Multiple tabs/windows**: Handle popups, multi-window workflows  
✅ **Test script execution**: Write/run `.spec.ts` files (assist testing contractor)  
✅ **Firefox/WebKit**: Cross-browser testing  
✅ **Headful mode**: Debug with visible browser when needed  
✅ **File upload/download**: Handle file I/O  

**Why Phase 2**: Important but can be added iteratively

### 5.3 Phase 3 (Later - Power Features)
✅ **Video recording**: Capture test execution  
✅ **Trace viewer**: Performance analysis  
✅ **PDF generation**: Report generation  
✅ **Accessibility testing**: Automated a11y checks  
✅ **Performance profiling**: Lighthouse integration  
✅ **Mobile emulation**: Device testing  

**Why Phase 3**: Advanced use cases, build on Phase 1+2

### 5.4 True Exclusions (Not Playwright's Job)

These are legitimately out of scope (not Playwright's purpose):
- ❌ Visual comparison algorithms (screenshot diffing is separate tool)
- ❌ Persistent sessions across MCP restarts (stateless by design)
- ❌ Test result storage/history (external test runner responsibility)
- ❌ CI/CD integration (orchestration layer above this tool)

**Everything else is IN SCOPE** - just phased for implementation

---

## 6. Constraints & Assumptions
