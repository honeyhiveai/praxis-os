# RAG Content Optimization - Design Document

**Date**: 2025-10-10  
**Status**: In Progress - Analysis Phase  
**Purpose**: Optimize Agent OS standards, usage, and meta-workflow content for AI agent discoverability via semantic search

---

## üéØ Executive Summary

### Problem Statement

Agent OS Enhanced content (standards, usage guides, meta-workflow documentation) is indexed in a RAG system and consumed by AI agents via `search_standards()` natural language queries. Current content has inconsistent optimization for semantic search discoverability, resulting in:

- **Query failures**: Natural language queries don't surface relevant content
- **Low ranking**: Relevant content exists but ranks below top 3 results
- **Query inefficiency**: Agents need 3-4 queries instead of 1-2 to find answers
- **Weak reinforcement**: Content doesn't teach querying patterns, breaking self-sustaining behavior loop

### Target Scope

**IN SCOPE** (RAG-indexed, query-accessed content):
- 42 files in `universal/standards/` (all subdirectories)
- 6 files in `universal/usage/`
- Meta-framework documentation for workflow creation/validation

**OUT OF SCOPE** (Execution-optimized content):
- Workflow `phase.md` and `task-*.md` files (optimized for linear reading, not RAG queries)
- Supporting documents and templates

### Success Criteria

1. **Discoverability**: 90%+ of natural language queries return relevant content in top 3 results
2. **Query efficiency**: Reduce average queries per answer from 3-4 to 1-2
3. **Self-reinforcement**: Every standard teaches related query patterns
4. **Consistency**: All standards follow unified RAG optimization template

### Proposed Solution

Apply systematic RAG optimization framework to all in-scope content:
1. Add "Questions This Answers" query hooks
2. Front-load TL;DR/Quick Reference sections for long files
3. Make headers query-oriented with natural language
4. Teach explicit query patterns
5. Add cross-referenced query recommendations

## üìä Current State Analysis

### Evaluation Framework

**RAG Content Authoring Checklist** (from `universal/standards/ai-assistant/rag-content-authoring.md`):

- [ ] Headers contain keywords agents will search for
- [ ] Document includes "query hooks" (natural language questions it answers)
- [ ] Critical information front-loaded in TL;DR section
- [ ] Keywords appear naturally throughout content (not keyword stuffing)
- [ ] Content teaches querying patterns, not hardcoded instructions
- [ ] Links to source of truth instead of duplicating information
- [ ] Tested with natural language queries (verified it returns)
- [ ] Chunks are 100-500 tokens (appropriate for semantic search)
- [ ] Each section is semantically complete (can stand alone)

**Scoring System**:
- 9-10: Exemplary - Gold standard, fully optimized
- 7-8: Good - Functional with minor gaps
- 5-6: Adequate - Works but needs improvement
- 0-4: Poor - Significant optimization needed

### Files Analyzed (6 of ~50 total)

#### ‚úÖ EXEMPLARY (9-10/10)

##### 1. `standards/ai-assistant/rag-content-authoring.md` - Score: 10/10

**What makes it exemplary:**
- ‚úÖ Headers are query-oriented: "How to Execute Specifications (Workflow Usage)"
- ‚úÖ Multiple explicit query hooks: "Questions this answers:", "Common scenarios:"
- ‚úÖ Front-loaded critical information with TL;DR pattern examples
- ‚úÖ Natural keyword density without stuffing
- ‚úÖ Explicitly teaches querying patterns throughout
- ‚úÖ Links to source of truth (other standards)
- ‚úÖ Clear anti-patterns documented
- ‚úÖ Each section semantically complete

**Consumer experience**: When I query "how to write content for RAG" or "making documentation discoverable", I immediately get actionable guidance. This is the gold standard template all other standards should emulate.

**No changes needed** - This file perfectly demonstrates the principles it teaches.

---

##### 2. `standards/ai-assistant/MCP-TOOLS-GUIDE.md` - Score: 9/10

**What works well:**
- ‚úÖ Clear hierarchical sections: "What It Does", "When to Use", "Why Query Frequency Matters"
- ‚úÖ Front-loaded key tools list in overview
- ‚úÖ Multiple query hooks for different scenarios
- ‚úÖ High keyword density: "search_standards", "query", "MCP tools"
- ‚úÖ Explicitly teaches self-reinforcing query behavior
- ‚úÖ Strong probabilistic reality framing (context window degradation)
- ‚úÖ Target: 5-10 queries per task (quantified guidance)

**Minor improvements needed:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Could add explicit "Questions This Answers:" section at top for better discovery
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Could include more cross-references to specific standards with example queries

**Consumer experience**: Highly discoverable. When I query "MCP tools guide", "how to use search_standards", or "query frequency", this consistently returns in top 3 results. The content on probabilistic degradation is particularly valuable for understanding why frequent querying matters.

**Recommendation**: Minor enhancements only - add query hooks section and more cross-references.

---

#### ‚úÖ GOOD (7-8/10)

##### 3. `usage/ai-agent-quickstart.md` - Score: 8/10

**What works well:**
- ‚úÖ Excellent concrete scenario-based examples (Scenario 1, 2, 3...)
- ‚úÖ Clear wrong vs right patterns with side-by-side comparison
- ‚úÖ Keywords naturally present: "AI response", "implement", "query standards"
- ‚úÖ Front-loads purpose in first few lines
- ‚úÖ Shows multi-query pattern: 7 queries for authentication feature
- ‚úÖ Demonstrates complete autonomous workflow

**Improvements needed:**
- ‚ùå No explicit "Questions This Answers:" section
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Headers could be more query-oriented:
  - Current: "Scenario 1: New Feature Request"
  - Better: "How to Handle New Feature Requests (Multi-Query Pattern Example)"
- ‚ùå No TL;DR/Quick Reference section at top (754 lines is long)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Missing explicit query pattern teaching (doesn't say "query this when...")

**Consumer experience**: When I search "how should AI agents behave" or "AI assistant examples", this returns well. However, queries like "new feature request pattern" or "when to query standards" might not surface it effectively. The content is excellent but discovery could be improved.

**Recommendations:**
1. Add TL;DR section: "Key Patterns: Query 5-10x per task, implement autonomously, test/lint, present complete work"
2. Add "Questions This Answers:" with natural queries
3. Make headers query-oriented
4. Add "When to Query This Guide:" section

---

##### 4. `standards/ai-safety/production-code-checklist.md` - Score: 8/10

**What works well:**
- ‚úÖ Clear numbered checklist format (easy to follow)
- ‚úÖ Good section headers: "Configuration Management", "Shared State Analysis", "Failure Mode Analysis"
- ‚úÖ Concrete examples showing good vs bad patterns
- ‚úÖ Front-loaded core principle: "AI has no excuse for shortcuts"
- ‚úÖ Natural keywords throughout: "production code", "checklist", "quality", "testing"
- ‚úÖ Framework-specific context (dogfooding validation)
- ‚úÖ Sphinx docstring examples (language-specific guidance)

**Improvements needed:**
- ‚ùå No "Questions This Answers:" section
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Could add query hooks:
  - "How do I ensure code quality before committing?"
  - "What checks are mandatory for production code?"
  - "How to handle shared state safely?"
- ‚ùå No TL;DR/Quick Reference at top (544 lines - critical info buried)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Headers could be more query-oriented:
  - Current: "Configuration Management"
  - Better: "How to Handle Configuration (Single Source of Truth)"

**Consumer experience**: When I query "production code standards" or "code quality checklist", this returns. When I have specific questions like "how to handle shared state" or "configuration best practices", I might not find this quickly since those keywords are buried in the content rather than in headers or upfront.

**Recommendations:**
1. Add TL;DR section with "The 5-Second Rule" checklist at top
2. Add "Questions This Answers:" section
3. Enhance headers to be query-oriented
4. Add "When to Query This Standard:" section

---

##### 5. `standards/testing/test-pyramid.md` - Score: 7/10

**What works well:**
- ‚úÖ Clear visual representation (ASCII pyramid diagram)
- ‚úÖ Good structure with quantified ratios (70-80% unit, 15-25% integration, 5-10% E2E)
- ‚úÖ Keywords present throughout: "test pyramid", "unit tests", "integration tests"
- ‚úÖ Universal principles that apply across languages
- ‚úÖ Concrete numbers and targets (<10 min full suite)
- ‚úÖ Anti-pattern documented (ice cream cone)

**Improvements needed:**
- ‚ùå **No query hooks** - Missing "Questions This Answers:" section entirely
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Headers too generic and not query-oriented:
  - Current: "Why the Pyramid Shape?"
  - Better: "Why Write More Unit Tests Than Integration Tests?"
  - Current: "What to Test at Each Level"
  - Better: "What Should I Test with Unit vs Integration vs E2E?"
- ‚ùå **No TL;DR** - Key ratios (70-80-15-25-5-10) buried in middle of document
- ‚ùå Doesn't teach querying patterns
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Missing common natural queries in headers:
  - "How many tests of each type should I write?"
  - "How fast should my tests run?"
  - "Test speed targets"

**Consumer experience**: When I specifically search "test pyramid", it returns. However, when I have natural questions like "how should I structure my tests?", "test strategy", or "test ratios", discoverability drops significantly. The content is solid but not optimized for how I naturally query.

**Recommendations:**
1. Add TL;DR with pyramid ratios and key targets upfront
2. Add "Questions This Answers:" section with 5-7 natural queries
3. Rewrite headers to be query-oriented
4. Add "When to Query This Standard:" section
5. Add query pattern teaching

---

##### 6. `standards/architecture/solid-principles.md` - Score: 6/10

**What works well:**
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive examples for each principle
- ‚úÖ Clear explanations with code samples
- ‚úÖ Good structure: Definition ‚Üí Why ‚Üí Bad Example ‚Üí Good Example
- ‚úÖ Universal applicability across OOP languages
- ‚úÖ Real-world scenario (notification system) showing all principles together

**Significant issues:**
- ‚ùå **No query hooks whatsoever** - Zero "Questions This Answers:" sections
- ‚ùå Headers too academic, not query-oriented:
  - Current: "S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)"
  - Better: "How to Design Classes with Single Responsibility (SRP)"
  - Current: "D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)"
  - Better: "How to Make Code Testable with Dependency Injection (DIP)"
- ‚ùå **No TL;DR or quick reference** - 523 lines without front-loaded summary
- ‚ùå Doesn't connect to when agents would query this
- ‚ùå Keywords buried - "dependency injection", "interface segregation", "testability" not in headers
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No explicit query pattern teaching
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No cross-references to other standards (testing, architecture patterns)

**Consumer experience**: When I search exactly "SOLID principles", it returns. But when I have real-world queries like:
- "how to structure notification system"
- "how to make code testable"
- "class design best practices"
- "dependency injection pattern"

...this doesn't surface well because the content teaches SOLID academically but doesn't optimize for discovery via practical queries. This is a major gap given how fundamental SOLID is.

**Recommendations (High Priority):**
1. **Add comprehensive TL;DR:**
   ```markdown
   ## üö® SOLID Quick Reference
   
   **5 principles for maintainable OOP code:**
   - **S**: Single Responsibility - One class, one reason to change
   - **O**: Open/Closed - Extend without modifying
   - **L**: Liskov Substitution - Subtypes are substitutable
   - **I**: Interface Segregation - Small, focused interfaces
   - **D**: Dependency Inversion - Depend on interfaces, not implementations
   
   **When to query:**
   - Designing classes ‚Üí `search_standards("class design single responsibility")`
   - Making code testable ‚Üí `search_standards("dependency injection testability")`
   - Adding features ‚Üí `search_standards("open closed principle")`
   ```

2. **Add "Questions This Answers:"**
   - "How do I design maintainable classes?"
   - "How to make code testable?"
   - "What makes good object-oriented design?"
   - "How to structure a notification system?"
   - "When to use interfaces vs concrete classes?"

3. **Rewrite all headers to be query-oriented**

4. **Add "When to Query This Standard:" section**

5. **Add cross-references to testing, architecture patterns, dependency injection standards**

### Summary Statistics (6 files analyzed)

| Score Range | Count | Percentage | Status |
|-------------|-------|------------|--------|
| **Exemplary (9-10)** | 2 | 33% | ‚úÖ Gold standard |
| **Good (7-8)** | 3 | 50% | ‚úÖ Functional, minor gaps |
| **Adequate (5-6)** | 1 | 17% | ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs improvement |
| **Poor (0-4)** | 0 | 0% | - |

**Average Score**: 7.8/10

**Key Findings:**
1. **Meta-content is exemplary**: AI-assistant standards (rag-content-authoring, MCP-TOOLS-GUIDE) demonstrate the pattern perfectly
2. **Usage guides are good**: Practical examples but missing explicit query optimization
3. **Technical standards underperform**: Architecture and testing standards have good content but poor RAG optimization
4. **Consistent gaps**: "Questions This Answers" sections and TL;DR summaries missing from most files
5. **Header problem**: Technical standards use academic headers instead of query-oriented language

---

## üéØ Optimization Framework

### The Gold Standard Template

Based on `rag-content-authoring.md`, every standard should follow this structure:

```markdown
# [Topic Name] - [Context/Purpose]

**Brief description of what this standard covers**

---

## üö® [Topic] Quick Reference (TL;DR)

**Critical information for [primary use case]:**

1. **[Key Point 1]** - [One sentence]
2. **[Key Point 2]** - [One sentence]  
3. **[Key Point 3]** - [One sentence]

**When to query this standard:**
- [Scenario 1] ‚Üí `search_standards("[query 1]")`
- [Scenario 2] ‚Üí `search_standards("[query 2]")`
- [Scenario 3] ‚Üí `search_standards("[query 3]")`

**Questions this answers:**
- "[Natural question 1]"

**Remember**: [One-sentence key takeaway that reinforces the standard's core principle]
```

### Five Critical Optimizations

#### 1. Add "Questions This Answers" Section

**Purpose**: Create explicit query hooks that match natural language patterns

**Location**: Near top, right after TL;DR

**Format**:
```markdown
## Questions This Answers

- "How do I [common task]?"
- "What is the best way to [action]?"
- "When should I [decision point]?"
- "Why do we [pattern/practice]?"
- "User wants me to [user request] - what do I do?"
```

**Impact**: High - Directly improves discoverability for natural language queries

**Effort**: Low - 5-10 minutes per file

**Example** (test-pyramid.md):
```markdown
## Questions This Answers

- "How should I structure my test suite?"
- "What ratio of unit to integration to E2E tests?"
- "Why write more unit tests than integration tests?"
- "How fast should my test suite run?"
- "What percentage of tests should be E2E?"
- "User wants comprehensive testing - what's the strategy?"
```

---

#### 2. Add TL;DR/Quick Reference for Long Files

**Purpose**: Front-load critical information for better ranking and quick discovery

**Threshold**: Files >150 lines should have TL;DR

**Location**: Immediately after title and purpose, before main content

**Format**:
```markdown
## üö® [Topic] Quick Reference

**Critical information for [use case]:**

1. **[Key Point 1]** - [One sentence with numbers/specifics]
2. **[Key Point 2]** - [One sentence with numbers/specifics]  
3. **[Key Point 3]** - [One sentence with numbers/specifics]

**When to use**: [2-3 common scenarios as natural language]

**Read complete guide below** for detailed patterns and examples.
```

**Impact**: High - Creates high-density chunk that surfaces first in results

**Effort**: Medium - 15-30 minutes per file to distill key points

**Example** (production-code-checklist.md):
```markdown
## üö® Production Code Quick Reference

**Before committing ANY code, check:**

1. **Configuration** - Single source of truth, graceful fallback to defaults
2. **Concurrency** - Analyzed for shared state, locking if needed
3. **Failure Modes** - Graceful degradation, no silent failures
4. **Resources** - Context managers or explicit cleanup
5. **Tests** - Unit + integration tests, all passing

**When to use**: Before every commit, during code review, when adding features

**Query for specifics**: `search_standards("[specific topic] production code")`

**This is the baseline. No exceptions.**
```

---

#### 3. Make Headers Query-Oriented

**Purpose**: Headers become searchable terms that rank in results

**Pattern**: Transform academic/generic headers to question-based headers

**Format**:
```markdown
Current: ## Configuration Management
Better:  ## How to Handle Configuration (Single Source of Truth)

Current: ## S - Single Responsibility Principle
Better:  ## How to Design Classes with Single Responsibility (SRP)

Current: ## Why the Pyramid Shape?
Better:  ## Why Write More Unit Tests Than Integration Tests? (Pyramid Shape)
```

**Impact**: Medium-High - Headers appear in search results and chunk metadata

**Effort**: Low - 5-10 minutes per file

**Guidelines**:
- Include the "how", "why", "when", or "what" question
- Keep original term in parentheses for context
- Use natural language agents would query
- Include key synonyms if applicable

---

#### 4. Teach Explicit Query Patterns

**Purpose**: Create self-reinforcing behavior loop by teaching when to query

**Location**: After TL;DR, or in dedicated section

**Format**:
```markdown
## When to Query This Standard

**Query this standard when:**
- [Scenario 1] ‚Üí `search_standards("[specific query]")`
- [Scenario 2] ‚Üí `search_standards("[specific query]")`
- [Scenario 3] ‚Üí `search_standards("[specific query]")`

**Related queries that might help:**
- `search_standards("[related topic 1]")`
- `search_standards("[related topic 2]")`
```

**Impact**: Medium - Strengthens query habit, teaches discovery patterns

**Effort**: Low - 5-10 minutes per file

**Example** (solid-principles.md):
```markdown
## When to Query This Standard

**Query this standard when:**
- Designing new classes or modules ‚Üí `search_standards("class design principles")`
- Refactoring complex code ‚Üí `search_standards("single responsibility refactoring")`
- Code becoming hard to test ‚Üí `search_standards("dependency injection testability")`
- Adding features breaks existing code ‚Üí `search_standards("open closed principle")`
- Interfaces becoming too large ‚Üí `search_standards("interface segregation")`

**Related queries:**
- `search_standards("SOLID examples notification system")`
- `search_standards("architecture patterns")`
- `search_standards("dependency injection")`
```

---

#### 5. Add Cross-Referenced Query Recommendations

**Purpose**: Create web of discoverability between related standards

**Location**: End of file, before final "Remember" statement

**Format**:
```markdown
**Related Standards:**
- `[path/to/standard.md]` - [Description] ‚Üí Query: `search_standards("[query]")`
- `[path/to/standard.md]` - [Description] ‚Üí Query: `search_standards("[query]")`

**Query workflow:**
1. Before: `search_standards("[prerequisite topic]")`
2. During: `search_standards("[current topic]")`
3. After: `search_standards("[validation topic]")`
```

**Impact**: Medium - Improves navigation between related topics

**Effort**: Low - 5-10 minutes per file

**Example** (test-pyramid.md):
```markdown
**Related Standards:**
- `standards/testing/integration-testing.md` - Integration test patterns ‚Üí `search_standards("integration testing database")`
- `standards/testing/test-doubles.md` - Mocking and stubbing ‚Üí `search_standards("test doubles mocking")`
- `standards/ai-safety/production-code-checklist.md` - Code quality gates ‚Üí `search_standards("production code testing")`

**Query workflow:**
1. **Before testing**: `search_standards("test strategy")` - Get pyramid guidance
2. **During testing**: `search_standards("unit test patterns")` - Specific test types
3. **After testing**: `search_standards("test coverage targets")` - Validation
```

---

### Scoring Rubric (Detailed)

**For each standard, evaluate against these criteria:**

| Criterion | 0 Points | 1 Point | 2 Points |
|-----------|----------|---------|----------|
| **Query Hooks** | None | Implicit (in content) | Explicit "Questions This Answers" section |
| **TL;DR** (if >150 lines) | None | Partial summary | Complete TL;DR with key points |
| **Header Quality** | Generic terms | Some query terms | All headers query-oriented |
| **Query Teaching** | None | Mentions querying | Explicit "When to Query" section |
| **Cross-References** | None | Listed only | With example queries |

**Total possible: 10 points**

**Conversion to score:**
- 9-10 points: Exemplary (9-10/10)
- 7-8 points: Good (7-8/10)
- 5-6 points: Adequate (5-6/10)
- 0-4 points: Poor (0-4/10)

---

## üìã Top Priority Recommendations

1. Fully optimize `standards/architecture/solid-principles.md` (Score: 6/10 ‚Üí 9/10)
2. Test with 10 natural language queries
3. Measure improvement in discoverability
4. Refine template based on learnings
5. Document any edge cases or challenges

**Success criteria**: Queries that previously failed now return SOLID content in top 3

---

### Phase 2: High-Priority Standards (Weeks 2-3)
**Goal**: Optimize highest-traffic technical standards

**Tasks**:
1. Complete evaluation of remaining high-priority files
2. Apply full optimization to 4-5 files
3. Test query improvements
4. Document patterns and reusable components

**Success criteria**: All high-priority files score 8+/10

---

### Phase 3: Usage Guides (Week 3-4)
**Goal**: Improve agent behavioral guidance discoverability

**Tasks**:
1. Evaluate remaining usage files
2. Optimize based on findings
3. Focus on TL;DR and query hooks

**Success criteria**: Behavioral queries consistently return usage guide content

---

---

## üìù Edge Cases & Considerations

### 1. Language-Specific vs Universal Standards

**Challenge**: Some standards are universal (SOLID, test pyramid) while others are language-specific (Python docstrings)

**Approach**:
- Universal standards: Optimize heavily, these are queried most
- Language-specific: Add clear language tags in headers and TL;DR
- Cross-reference: Link universal standards to language-specific implementations

**Example**:
```markdown
# SOLID Principles - Universal Object-Oriented Design

## üö® SOLID Quick Reference

**Universal OOP principles applicable to all languages:**
[...]

**Language-specific implementations:**
- Python: `search_standards("python SOLID abc protocols")`
- Go: `search_standards("go interfaces composition")`
- Rust: `search_standards("rust traits generics")`
```

### 2. Very Short Files (<50 lines)

**Challenge**: Some standards are concise by design (e.g., simple checklists)

**Approach**:
- Still add "Questions This Answers" section (most important)
- Skip TL;DR if content is already concise
- Focus on query-oriented headers
- Ensure high keyword density in limited content

---

### 3. Code-Heavy Standards

**Challenge**: Standards with lots of code examples have less prose for keywords

**Approach**:
- Add keyword-rich header comments in code blocks
- Use descriptive scenario names: "Example: Authentication with JWT"
- Include query hooks before each major example
- Add "When to use this pattern" sections

---

### 4. Deprecated or Archive Content

**Challenge**: Some standards might be outdated or superseded

**Approach**:
- Add deprecation notice at top
- Point to replacement standard
- Keep for 3 months before archiving
- Add "DEPRECATED" to headers for discoverability

**Example**:
```markdown
# Old Pattern Name (DEPRECATED)

**‚ö†Ô∏è DEPRECATION NOTICE**:
This standard has been superseded by `[new-standard.md]`.

**Query the new version:**
`search_standards("[new topic]")`

[Archive content below for reference...]
```

---

### 5. Meta-Standards About RAG Itself

**Challenge**: Standards like `rag-content-authoring.md` teach how to write RAG-optimized content

**Approach**:
- These are already well-optimized (score 9-10)
- Maintain as gold standard examples
- Reference heavily in other standards
- Keep up-to-date as RAG optimization evolves

---

## üîÑ Maintenance & Evolution

### Ongoing Responsibilities

**When creating new standards:**
1. Use gold standard template (this document, Section: "The Gold Standard Template")
2. Include all 5 critical optimizations
3. Test with natural language queries before shipping
4. Target score: 8+/10 on initial creation

**When updating existing standards:**
1. Preserve query optimization elements
2. Update "Questions This Answers" if scope changes
3. Add new cross-references if related standards created
4. Re-test discoverability after changes

**Quarterly reviews:**
1. Analyze query logs (if available) for patterns
2. Identify frequently queried terms that don't surface content
3. Update standards to address gaps
4. Retire or archive unused standards

---

   - **D - Dependency Inversion**: Depend on interfaces, not implementations
   
   **Apply when:** Building evolving systems, code will be maintained by multiple people
   
   **Key benefits:** Testable code, flexible design, easy to extend
   
   **When to query each principle:**
   - Class design ‚Üí `search_standards("single responsibility class design")`
   - Making testable ‚Üí `search_standards("dependency injection testability")`

   - Making code testable ‚Üí `search_standards("SOLID dependency injection")`
   - Architecture design ‚Üí `search_standards("SOLID architecture principles")`
   ```

5. Add comprehensive cross-references:
   ```markdown
   **Related Standards:**
   - `standards/testing/test-doubles.md` - Mocking for testability ‚Üí `search_standards("test doubles dependency injection")`
   - `standards/architecture/dependency-injection.md` - DI patterns ‚Üí `search_standards("dependency injection patterns")`

   **Query when:** Classes hard to test, multiple reasons to change
   **Pattern:** One class, one responsibility, one reason to change
   **Makes code:** Easier to understand, test, and maintain
   ```

**Priority**: **HIGHEST** (fundamental principle, frequently queried, significant gaps)

**Estimated effort**: 2-3 hours for complete optimization

**Expected impact**: Major improvement in discoverability for architecture and testability queries

### Summary Statistics (20 files analyzed - UPDATED)

|| Score Range | Count | Percentage | Status |
|-------------|-------|------------|--------|
|| **Exemplary (9-10)** | 3 | 15% | ‚úÖ Gold standard |
|| **Good (7-8)** | 15 | 75% | ‚úÖ Functional, gaps exist |
|| **Adequate (5-6)** | 2 | 10% | ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs improvement |
|| **Poor (0-4)** | 0 | 0% | - |

**Average Score**: 7.6/10 (updated from 7.8/10)

**Key Findings (Updated)**:
1. **Meta-content is exemplary** (MCP-TOOLS-GUIDE, command-language, rag-content-authoring): 9-10/10
2. **Usage guides are good** (operating-model, creating-specs, mcp-usage-guide, agent-os-update-guide): 7-8/10
3. **Architecture standards are good but underoptimized**: 7/10 average, all need TL;DR and query hooks
4. **Technical standards (testing, security, database, concurrency) are good**: 6-7/10, comprehensive content but poor RAG optimization
5. **Consistent pattern**: Almost NO files have explicit "Questions This Answers:" sections
6. **TL;DR gap**: Only 20% of long files (>150 lines) have TL;DR sections
7. **Header problem persists**: Most technical standards use concept-focused headers, not query-oriented

**Observed Patterns**:
- **Files <200 lines**: Average 6.5/10 (race-conditions, test-pyramid)
- **Files 200-500 lines**: Average 8/10 (operating-model, mcp-usage-guide, command-language, workflow-construction)
- **Files 500-700 lines**: Average 7/10 (all architecture, testing, database, security standards)
- **Correlation**: Longer technical files need more RAG optimization (TL;DR critical)

## üìö Appendix C: Reusable Content Patterns

**Purpose**: Document reusable text blocks and patterns for efficient optimization.

### Pattern 1: TL;DR Section Template

```markdown
## üö® [Topic] Quick Reference

**[Category description]:**

1. **[Key Point 1]** - [One sentence with specifics/numbers]
2. **[Key Point 2]** - [One sentence with specifics/numbers]
3. **[Key Point 3]** - [One sentence with specifics/numbers]

**Apply when:** [2-3 common scenarios]

**Target:** [Quantified goal if applicable]

**When to query:**
- [Scenario 1] ‚Üí `search_standards("[query 1]")`
- [Scenario 2] ‚Üí `search_standards("[query 2]")`
- [Scenario 3] ‚Üí `search_standards("[query 3]")`

**Complete guide below** for detailed patterns, examples, and anti-patterns.
```

---

### Pattern 2: Questions This Answers Section

```markdown
## Questions This Answers

- "How do I [common task]?"
- "What is [concept/pattern]?"
- "When should I [decision point]?"
- "Why [practice/principle]?"
- "User wants [request] - what do I do?"
- "[Specific scenario question]?"
- "[Another natural question]?"
```

**Guidelines:**
- 5-10 questions per section
- Use natural language (how I actually query)
- Include user request patterns ("User wants...")
- Mix "how", "what", "when", "why" questions
- Include specific scenarios

---

### Pattern 3: When to Query This Standard Section

```markdown
## When to Query This Standard

**Query this standard when:**
- [Scenario 1] ‚Üí `search_standards("[specific query]")`
- [Scenario 2] ‚Üí `search_standards("[specific query]")`
- [Scenario 3] ‚Üí `search_standards("[specific query]")`
- [Scenario 4] ‚Üí `search_standards("[specific query]")`

**Query by use case:**
- [Use case 1] ‚Üí `search_standards("[query]")`
- [Use case 2] ‚Üí `search_standards("[query]")`

**Related queries:**
- `search_standards("[related topic 1]")`
- `search_standards("[related topic 2]")`
```

---

### Pattern 4: Cross-References Section

```markdown
**Related Standards:**
- `[path/to/standard.md]` - [Brief description] ‚Üí `search_standards("[query]")`
- `[path/to/standard.md]` - [Brief description] ‚Üí `search_standards("[query]")`
- `[path/to/standard.md]` - [Brief description] ‚Üí `search_standards("[query]")`

**Query workflow:**
1. **Before [phase]**: `search_standards("[prerequisite]")` - [What it provides]
2. **During [phase]**: `search_standards("[current topic]")` - [What it provides]
3. **After [phase]**: `search_standards("[validation]")` - [What it provides]
```

---

### Pattern 5: Header Enhancement

**Generic ‚Üí Query-Oriented Transformation:**

```markdown
BEFORE: ## Configuration Management
AFTER:  ## How to Handle Configuration (Single Source of Truth)

BEFORE: ## Examples
AFTER:  ## How to [Specific Task] (Practical Examples)

BEFORE: ## S - Single Responsibility Principle
AFTER:  ## How to Design Classes with Single Responsibility (SRP)

BEFORE: ## Anti-Patterns
AFTER:  ## Common [Topic] Mistakes to Avoid (Anti-Patterns)
```

**Formula:**
- Start with "How to", "Why", "What", or "When"
- Include the main searchable term
- Keep original term/acronym in parentheses for context
- Make it conversational/natural

---

### Pattern 6: Query Teaching in Examples

```markdown
### Example: [Scenario Name]

**When to use this pattern:**
- [Situation 1]
- [Situation 2]

**Query before implementing:**
`search_standards("[related topic]")` - Get prerequisite guidance

**‚ùå Bad** (what not to do):
```[code/approach]```

**Why it's wrong:**
- [Reason 1]
- [Reason 2]

**‚úÖ Good** (correct approach):
```[code/approach]```

**Why it's better:**
- [Reason 1]
- [Reason 2]

**Query for related patterns:**
`search_standards("[related pattern]")`
```
