**User:**

[TASK RESUMPTION] This task was interrupted just now. It may or may not be complete, so please reassess the task context. Be aware that the project state may have changed since then. The current working directory is now '/Users/josh/src/github.com/cline/cline'. If the task has not been completed, retry the last step before interruption and proceed with completing the task.

Note: If you previously attempted a tool use that the user did not provide a result for, you should assume the tool use was not successful and assess whether you should retry. If the last tool was a browser_action, the browser has been closed and you must launch a new browser if needed.
New instructions for task continuation:
<user_message>
you are broken in terminal, use the browser
</user_message>


# TODO LIST RECOMMENDED
When starting a new task, it is recommended to create a todo list.




1. Include the task_progress parameter in your next tool call

2. Create a comprehensive checklist of all steps needed

3. Use markdown format: - [ ] for incomplete, - [x] for complete



**Benefits of creating a todo list now:**

	- Clear roadmap for implementation

	- Progress tracking throughout the task

	- Nothing gets forgotten or missed

	- Users can see, monitor, and edit the plan



**Example structure:**
```

- [ ] Analyze requirements

- [ ] Set up necessary files

- [ ] Implement main functionality

- [ ] Handle edge cases

- [ ] Test the implementation

- [ ] Verify results
```



Keeping the todo list updated helps track progress and ensures nothing is missed.

I'll use the browser to create the GitHub issue. Let me navigate to the repository's issues page.

**User:**

The browser action has been executed. The console logs and screenshot have been captured for your analysis.

Console logs:
(No new logs)

(REMEMBER: if you need to proceed to using non-`browser_action` tools or launch a new browser, you MUST first close this browser. For example, if after analyzing the logs and screenshot you need to edit a file, you must first close the browser before you can use the write_to_file tool.)

## GitHub Issue Creation - Manual Steps Required

GitHub requires authentication which I cannot perform on your behalf. The issue content is ready in **GITHUB_ISSUE_DRAFT.md** for you to post manually.

### 📝 How to Post the Issue:

**Option 1: Using GitHub Web Interface**
1. Go to: https://github.com/cline/cline/issues/new
2. Sign in to GitHub
3. Copy content from `GITHUB_ISSUE_DRAFT.md`
4. Paste into the issue form:
   - **Title:** `[BUG] StreamableHTTP transport not properly supported for remote MCP servers`
   - **Labels:** Add `bug` and `mcp`
   - **Body:** Use the full content from the "Body" section in GITHUB_ISSUE_DRAFT.md
5. Click "Submit new issue"

**Option 2: Using GitHub CLI (if already authenticated)**
```bash
cd /Users/josh/src/github.com/cline/cline
gh issue create \
  --title "[BUG] StreamableHTTP transport not properly supported for remote MCP servers" \
  --body-file GITHUB_ISSUE_DRAFT.md \
  --label "bug,mcp"
```

### 📋 What We've Prepared:

✅ **MCP_STREAMABLEHTTP_BUG_ANALYSIS.md** - Complete technical analysis with:
- Root cause analysis (exact code locations and line numbers)
- Test cases demonstrating the bug
- Comprehensive fix design
- Backward compatibility guarantee
- Testing requirements
- Documentation updates needed
- Rollout plan

✅ **GITHUB_ISSUE_DRAFT.md** - Ready-to-post issue with:
- Clear bug description covering both issues
- Reproduction steps for both bugs
- Proposed fixes (phased approach)
- Relationship to #3315
- Implementation plan

### 🎯 Next Steps After Posting:

1. **Post the Issue** using one of the methods above
2. **Note the Issue Number** (e.g., #6789)
3. **Wait for Maintainer Response** - They may:
   - Approve immediately
   - Ask questions
   - Request changes
   - Suggest different approach
4. **Once Approved** - I can then:
   - Create detailed spec using prAxIs OS
   - Implement the fix systematically
   - Create PR with comprehensive tests
   - Submit with proper changeset

### 📄 Issue Summary:

**Title:** StreamableHTTP transport not properly supported for remote MCP servers

**Key Points:**
- Bug 1: Default selection always chooses SSE instead of StreamableHTTP
- Bug 2: Even manual configuration has issues (per #3315)
- Impact: Blocks entire ecosystem from using modern transport
- Fix: Phased approach (default selection + implementation issues)
- Type: Patch (non-breaking bug fix)

### 🔧 Files Ready for Implementation:

Once maintainers approve, all analysis is complete and ready:
- Root cause identified
- Fix designed and documented
- Tests planned
- Documentation updates outlined
- Rollout strategy defined

**Your Action Required:** Post the issue manually and let me know the issue number once created.
</result>
<task_progress>

I'll create a script that runs the gh command and captures the output to a temp file.

<write_to_file>

TEMP_FILE="/tmp/gh_issue_output_$$.txt"

# Print the temp file location
