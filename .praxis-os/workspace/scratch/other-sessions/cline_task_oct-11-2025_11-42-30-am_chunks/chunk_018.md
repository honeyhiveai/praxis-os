**User:**

[TASK RESUMPTION] This task was interrupted just now. It may or may not be complete, so please reassess the task context. Be aware that the project state may have changed since then. The current working directory is now '/Users/josh/src/github.com/cline/cline'. If the task has not been completed, retry the last step before interruption and proceed with completing the task.

Note: If you previously attempted a tool use that the user did not provide a result for, you should assume the tool use was not successful and assess whether you should retry. If the last tool was a browser_action, the browser has been closed and you must launch a new browser if needed.

IMPORTANT: If the last tool use was a replace_in_file or write_to_file that was interrupted, the file was reverted back to its original state before the interrupted edit, and you do NOT need to re-read the file as you already have its up-to-date contents.

# TODO LIST RECOMMENDED
When starting a new task, it is recommended to create a todo list.




1. Include the task_progress parameter in your next tool call

2. Create a comprehensive checklist of all steps needed

3. Use markdown format: - [ ] for incomplete, - [x] for complete



**Benefits of creating a todo list now:**

	- Clear roadmap for implementation

	- Progress tracking throughout the task

	- Nothing gets forgotten or missed

	- Users can see, monitor, and edit the plan



**Example structure:**
```

- [ ] Analyze requirements

- [ ] Set up necessary files

- [ ] Implement main functionality

- [ ] Handle edge cases

- [ ] Test the implementation

- [ ] Verify results
```



Keeping the todo list updated helps track progress and ensures nothing is missed.

<result>
## ✅ GitHub Issue Successfully Created!

**Issue #6767:** [BUG] StreamableHTTP transport not properly supported for remote MCP servers  
**URL:** https://github.com/cline/cline/issues/6767

---

### 📋 What Was Accomplished:

#### 1. **Deep Code Analysis** ✅
- Identified exact root cause in `McpHub.ts` and `schemas.ts`
- Found missing `type` field in `addRemoteServer()` (line 1004-1008)
- Discovered schema union resolution order bug
- Confirmed StreamableHTTP implementation itself is correct

#### 2. **Comprehensive Documentation** ✅
- **MCP_STREAMABLEHTTP_BUG_ANALYSIS.md** - Complete technical analysis
  - Root cause with exact code locations
  - Test cases demonstrating bugs
  - Comprehensive fix design
  - Backward compatibility guarantee
  - Testing requirements
  - Documentation updates
  - Rollout plan

#### 3. **GitHub Issue Created** ✅
- Issue #6767 posted with full context
- Describes both default selection and implementation issues
- References #3315 for related HTTP method bug
- Provides clear reproduction steps
- Proposes phased fix approach
- Labels can be added manually if needed

---

### 🎯 What the Issue Covers:

**Bug 1: Default Selection**
- New servers automatically default to deprecated SSE
- Fix: Add explicit `type: "streamableHttp"` + reorder schema union

**Bug 2: Implementation Issues**
- References #3315 for HTTP method problems
- Requires investigation and possible SDK updates

**Impact:**
- Blocks entire Cline ecosystem from using modern StreamableHTTP
- Violates MCP v1.0 specification recommendations
- Users can't discover or test StreamableHTTP features

---

### 🚀 Next Steps:

**1. Wait for Maintainer Response** ⏳
- Monitor issue #6767 for comments
- They may:
  - Approve immediately
  - Ask clarifying questions
  - Request changes to approach
  - Assign to someone

**2. Once Approved** 🛠️
- Create detailed spec using Agent OS Enhanced workflow
- Implement fix systematically with phase gating
- Create comprehensive test suite
- Submit PR with changeset (type: patch)
- Update documentation

**3. Implementation Plan Ready** 📦
All analysis complete:
- ✅ Root cause identified with exact line numbers
- ✅ Fix designed and documented  
- ✅ Tests planned (unit, integration, E2E)
- ✅ Documentation updates outlined
- ✅ Rollout strategy defined
- ✅ Backward compatibility guaranteed

---

### 📊 Issue Summary:

**Type:** Bug (non-breaking fix)  
**Severity:** High (blocks modern transport adoption)  
**Complexity:** Low for default selection fix  
**Risk:** Low (fully backward compatible)  
**Files:** `McpHub.ts`, `schemas.ts`

**The issue is now in maintainers' hands. Once they approve, I'm ready to implement the complete fix!**
