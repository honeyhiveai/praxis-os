## GitHub Issue Search Results - MCP Transport Bug

### üîç Search Completed

I searched the cline/cline repository for issues related to MCP remote servers, transport types, SSE, and streamableHttp.

**Search Terms Used:**
- "MCP transport SSE streamableHttp" - No results
- "MCP remote server" - 7 open, 21 closed issues found

### üìã Findings:

**Related Open Issues Found:**
1. #6253 - Remote Server UI redirect issue
2. #5208 - Remote MCP resource_link support
3. #4523 - MCP OAuth support
4. #4391 - General MCP system issues
5. #4356 - Terminal integration
6. #4352 - Remote SSH environment
7. #3144 - mcp.json configuration reuse

**Critical Finding:** ‚ùå **NO EXISTING ISSUE** for the specific bug we've identified:
- Remote MCP servers defaulting to deprecated SSE transport instead of StreamableHTTP
- Schema resolution order causing incorrect transport selection
- `addRemoteServer()` missing explicit `type` field

### ‚úÖ Conclusion: NEW ISSUE REQUIRED

The bug we've documented in MCP_TRANSPORT_ANALYSIS.md and MCP_TRANSPORT_FIX_DESIGN.md has **not been reported**.

### üìù Recommended Next Steps:

**1. Create GitHub Issue**

**Title:** `[BUG] Remote MCP servers default to deprecated SSE transport instead of StreamableHTTP`

**Body Template:**
```markdown
## Bug Description
When adding remote MCP servers via `addRemoteServer()` or the UI, they incorrectly default to the deprecated SSE transport instead of the modern StreamableHTTP transport specified in MCP v1.0.

## Root Cause
1. `addRemoteServer()` creates config without explicit `type` field
2. Zod schema union checks SSE before StreamableHTTP
3. Both transports match URL-based configs, SSE matches first

## Impact
- New users unknowingly use deprecated transport
- Potential compatibility issues as ecosystem moves away from SSE
- Against MCP specification recommendations

## Analysis Documents
Full technical analysis available in PR (to be created after approval):
- Root cause analysis
- Comprehensive fix design
- Test coverage plan
- Backward compatibility guarantee

## Proposed Fix
1. Reorder schema union (StreamableHTTP before SSE)
2. Add explicit `type: "streamableHttp"` in addRemoteServer()
3. Add deprecation warnings for SSE
4. Full backward compatibility maintained

## References
- MCP Specification v1.0 recommends StreamableHTTP
- Affects: `src/services/mcp/McpHub.ts`, `src/services/mcp/schemas.ts`
- Type: Bug fix (patch), non-breaking change
```

**2. Wait for Maintainer Approval**
- Monitor issue for maintainer response
- Address any questions or clarifications
- Get explicit approval before creating PR

**3. Implementation (After Approval)**
Once approved, proceed with:
- Cursor creates spec using Agent OS Enhanced
- Systematic implementation via workflow
- Comprehensive testing
- PR with changeset

### üéØ Current Status:

**READY TO CREATE ISSUE** ‚úÖ

All analysis complete, design document updated, no duplicate found. The next action requires creating the GitHub issue and waiting for maintainer approval per CONTRIBUTING.md guidelines.

Would you like me to draft the complete GitHub issue text, or would you prefer to create it directly?

## GitHub Issue Analysis Complete - NEW ISSUE REQUIRED

### üîç Issue #3315 Review:

**Title:** "Cline does not work with StreamableHttpTransport based MCP servers"  
**Status:** CLOSED (but comments indicate still broken)  
**Problem:** Cline uses GET method instead of POST when connecting to StreamableHTTP servers

### üéØ Key Finding: DIFFERENT BUG

Issue #3315 addresses a **different problem**:
- **#3315 Bug**: Wrong HTTP method (GET vs POST) when using StreamableHTTP
- **Our Bug**: Wrong default transport (SSE vs StreamableHTTP) when adding servers

**Evidence from #3315:**
- Users were **manually specifying** transport type in configs:
  - `"transportType": "http"` (legacy)
  - Using streamableHttp explicitly
- Issue was about "wires getting crossed between the two transport layers"
- PR #3413 was submitted but issue persists

**Our Bug (NOT in #3315):**
- `addRemoteServer()` doesn't set explicit type field
- Schema defaults to SSE instead of StreamableHTTP
- Users don't know they're using deprecated transport
- Happens automatically, not by user choice

### ‚úÖ Conclusion: CREATE NEW ISSUE

Our bug analysis in MCP_TRANSPORT_ANALYSIS.md and MCP_TRANSPORT_FIX_DESIGN.md describes a **distinct, unreported bug**.

### üìù Recommended GitHub Issue:

**Title:** `[BUG] Remote MCP servers default to deprecated SSE transport instead of StreamableHTTP`

**Labels:** bug

**Description:**
```markdown
## Bug Description
When adding remote MCP servers via the UI or `addRemoteServer()` API, they default to the deprecated SSE transport instead of the modern StreamableHTTP transport specified in MCP v1.0 spec.

## Root Cause
1. `addRemoteServer()` in `src/services/mcp/McpHub.ts` (lines 1004-1008) creates server config without explicit `type` field
2. Zod schema union in `src/services/mcp/schemas.ts` checks SSE before StreamableHTTP
3. Both schemas match URL-based configs, SSE matches first and becomes default

## Impact
- New users unknowingly use deprecated SSE transport
- Against MCP specification v1.0 recommendations
- Potential compatibility issues as ecosystem migrates to StreamableHTTP
- Users must manually edit JSON to use modern transport

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Add remote MCP server via UI: Settings ‚Üí MCP Servers ‚Üí Add Server
2. Enter name and URL
3. Check generated config in `cline_mcp_settings.json`
4. Result: `"type": "sse"` instead of `"type": "streamableHttp"`

## Expected Behavior
New remote servers should default to `streamableHttp` transport per MCP v1.0 spec.

## Proposed Fix
1. Reorder schema union: StreamableHTTP before SSE
2. Add explicit `type: "streamableHttp"` in addRemoteServer()
3. Add deprecation warnings for SSE usage
4. Full backward compatibility maintained (existing SSE configs continue working)

## Additional Context
- Non-breaking change (patch version)
- Comprehensive analysis and design documents prepared
- All changes identified and documented
- Test coverage plan ready

## Related Issues
- Different from #3315 (HTTP method bug when using StreamableHTTP)
- This issue is about default transport selection

## Files Affected
- `src/services/mcp/McpHub.ts`
- `src/services/mcp/schemas.ts`
- `src/services/mcp/types.ts`
```

### üöÄ Next Steps:

1. **Create Issue** on GitHub with above template
2. **Wait for Maintainer Approval** (required per CONTRIBUTING.md)
3. **Once Approved**:
   - Cursor creates spec using Agent OS Enhanced
   - Systematic implementation via phase-gated workflow
   - Create PR with changeset (type: patch)
   - Include comprehensive tests

### üìä Summary:

**Status:** Ready to create new issue ‚úÖ  
**Analysis:** Complete and accurate ‚úÖ  
**Design:** Comprehensive and reviewed ‚úÖ  
**Contributing Guidelines:** Understood ‚úÖ  
**Duplicate Check:** No duplicate found ‚úÖ  
**Issue Template:** Prepared ‚úÖ

The MCP transport default bug has been thoroughly analyzed and is ready for GitHub issue creation and subsequent implementation through Agent OS Enhanced workflow.
