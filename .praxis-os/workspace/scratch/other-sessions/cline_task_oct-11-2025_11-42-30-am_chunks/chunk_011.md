fix(mcp): default remote servers to streamableHttp transport

- Add explicit type field to addRemoteServer() config
- Reorder schema union to prioritize streamableHttp
- Add deprecation warnings for SSE transport
- Maintain full backward compatibility

Fixes #[issue-number]
```

**6. PR Structure**

**Title**: `fix: Default remote MCP servers to StreamableHTTP transport`

**Description Template**:
```markdown
## Description
Fixes remote MCP servers defaulting to deprecated SSE transport instead of modern StreamableHTTP.

## Changes
- Updated `addRemoteServer()` to explicitly set `type: "streamableHttp"`
- Reordered schema union to prioritize StreamableHTTP over SSE
- Added deprecation warnings for SSE usage
- Added telemetry for transport type tracking
- Enhanced error messages with transport type

## Testing
- [x] Unit tests pass
- [x] Integration tests pass  
- [x] E2E tests pass
- [x] Tested manually with remote server
- [x] Verified backward compatibility with existing SSE configs

## Breaking Changes
None - fully backward compatible

## Screenshots/Demo
[If applicable]

Closes #[issue-number]
```

# TODO LIST RECOMMENDED
When starting a new task, it is recommended to create a todo list.




1. Include the task_progress parameter in your next tool call

2. Create a comprehensive checklist of all steps needed

3. Use markdown format: - [ ] for incomplete, - [x] for complete



**Benefits of creating a todo list now:**

	- Clear roadmap for implementation

	- Progress tracking throughout the task

	- Nothing gets forgotten or missed

	- Users can see, monitor, and edit the plan



**Example structure:**
```

- [ ] Analyze requirements

- [ ] Set up necessary files

- [ ] Implement main functionality

- [ ] Handle edge cases

- [ ] Test the implementation

- [ ] Verify results
```



Keeping the todo list updated helps track progress and ensures nothing is missed.

## Summary: MCP Transport Fix - Ready for Next Steps

### ‚úÖ Completed Work:

1. **Reviewed MCP_TRANSPORT_ANALYSIS.md** - Confirmed accurate root cause identification
2. **Reviewed MCP_TRANSPORT_FIX_DESIGN.md** - Initially provided by Cursor
3. **Updated Design Document** with critical corrections:
   - Fixed implementation order (schema first, then addRemoteServer)
   - Corrected SSE implementation details
   - Added telemetry for transport type tracking
   - Enhanced error messages with transport type
   - Added type safety improvements (`as const`)
   - Included RPC handler verification requirement
4. **Reviewed CONTRIBUTING.md** - Understood contribution requirements
5. **Learned Agent OS Enhanced** - Prepared for systematic spec creation workflow

### üìã Current Status:

**Design Document**: ‚úÖ Complete and technically accurate
**Issue Search**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Terminal command hung - unable to verify if issue exists

### üöÄ Recommended Next Steps:

Since the `gh` command hung, here are alternative approaches to check for existing issues:

**Option 1: Manual GitHub Search**
- Visit: https://github.com/cline/cline/issues
- Search terms: "MCP transport SSE streamableHttp", "remote server transport", "SSE deprecated"

**Option 2: Proceed with Creating Issue**
Given the thorough analysis in MCP_TRANSPORT_ANALYSIS.md, this appears to be a legitimate bug that likely hasn't been reported. You could:
1. Create the GitHub issue now
2. Reference both analysis documents
3. Wait for maintainer approval
4. Then proceed with Cursor using Agent OS Enhanced

**Option 3: Ask Maintainer Directly**
Post in Discussions or Discord to confirm if this is a known issue.

### üìù What Cursor Needs from You:

For Cursor to create the spec using Agent OS Enhanced, you'll need to:

1. **Confirm Issue Status**: Either find existing issue or create new one
2. **Get Approval**: Wait for maintainer green light
3. **Provide Context**: Give Cursor the issue number and design document

Then Cursor can use Agent OS Enhanced to:
- Create detailed spec in `.praxis-os/specs/`
- Implement systematically with phase gating
- Include all tests and documentation

### üéØ Design Doc Summary for Cursor:

**Critical Path Implementation:**
1. Reorder schema union (schemas.ts) - StreamableHTTP before SSE
2. Add explicit type to addRemoteServer() - `type: "streamableHttp" as const`
3. Add deprecation warnings for SSE usage
4. Add telemetry tracking
5. Update type definitions

**Testing Required:**
- Unit tests for schema resolution
- E2E test for UI server addition
- Backward compatibility verification

**Non-Breaking Change:** ‚úÖ All existing SSE configs continue working

The design document is production-ready and waiting for GitHub issue approval to proceed.
