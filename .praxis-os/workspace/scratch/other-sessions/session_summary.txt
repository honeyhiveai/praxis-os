# TODO LIST RECOMMENDED
When starting a new task, it is recommended to create a todo list.




1. Include the task_progress parameter in your next tool call

2. Create a comprehensive checklist of all steps needed

3. Use markdown format: - [ ] for incomplete, - [x] for complete



**Benefits of creating a todo list now:**

	- Clear roadmap for implementation

	- Progress tracking throughout the task

	- Nothing gets forgotten or missed

	- Users can see, monitor, and edit the plan

**Example:**
```markdown
# Session: Create MCP Server for GitHub API

## Task
Create MCP server that provides GitHub tools (issues, PRs, repos)

## Approach
Agent OS followed spec_creation ‚Üí implementation workflow

## What Worked
- Comprehensive spec created in 30 min
- All tools implemented with tests
- Production code checklist followed

## What Didn't Work
- Initial attempt forgot error handling
- Had to iterate on authentication

## Deliverable
Working MCP server with 8 tools, full test coverage

## Metrics
- Estimated: 6 hours human
- Actual: 45 min active time
- Leverage: ~8x
```

## Suggested Workflow

**For this document project:**

1. **I'll write current session perspective now** (fresh in memory)
2. **You create 3-5 session summaries** (pick most representative)
3. **I read and synthesize** (identify patterns)
4. **I write comprehensive perspective** (multi-session insights)

**This gives us:**
- Quick win: Document 1 today
- Comprehensive: Document 2 after you summarize
- Manageable: Only 15-30 min of your time

---

## Start Small

**Pick your 2-3 most interesting sessions** (not all of them):
- One that went really well
- One that had challenges
- One that showcased unique aspect

**Create quick summaries in:**
```
other-sessions/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ session-best-success.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ session-had-challenges.md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ session-unique-aspect.md
```

**Then tell me and I'll:**
1. Read all three
2. Look for patterns
3. Synthesize insights
4. Write comprehensive perspective

---

## Decision Point

**What would you like to do?**

**Option A:** I write current-session perspective now (ready in 10 min)
- You can add other sessions later
- We update document as we go

**Option B:** You create 2-3 quick summaries first (15-30 min)
- Then I write comprehensive doc
- Includes multiple sessions from start

**Option C:** Both - I write A now, you do B later, I write comprehensive version
- Best of both worlds
- Progressive enhancement

**Your call!** I'm ready to proceed however you prefer. üìù
