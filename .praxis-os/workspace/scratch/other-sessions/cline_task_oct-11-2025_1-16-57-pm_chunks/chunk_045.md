Issue body actions

### Bug Description

Remote MCP servers cannot properly use the StreamableHTTP transport recommended by MCP v1.0 specification due to multiple issues:

1.  **Default Selection Bug:** New servers automatically default to deprecated SSE transport instead of StreamableHTTP
2.  **Configuration Bug:** Even when users manually set `"type": "streamableHttp"`, there are implementation issues (see [Cline does not work with StreamableHttpTransport based MCP servers¬†#3315](https://github.com/cline/cline/issues/3315) for HTTP method problems)

This prevents Cline users from adopting the modern StreamableHTTP transport at all.

### Impact

*   **All new remote servers** automatically use deprecated SSE transport
*   Users cannot easily discover or test StreamableHTTP functionality
*   Violates MCP v1.0 specification recommendations
*   Blocks ecosystem migration from SSE to StreamableHTTP
*   Makes it impossible to use StreamableHTTP-only MCP servers

### Root Cause Analysis

#### Bug 1: Default Transport Selection

`addRemoteServer()` in `src/services/mcp/McpHub.ts` (lines 1004-1008) creates server config **without an explicit `type` field**:

const serverConfig \= {
    url: serverUrl,           // ‚úÖ Present
    disabled: false,          // ‚úÖ Present  
    autoApprove: \[\],          // ‚úÖ Present
    // ‚ùå MISSING: type field!
}

The Zod schema union in `src/services/mcp/schemas.ts` then tries matching in this order:

z.union(\[
    StdioSchema,         // 1st: Requires 'command' field
    SSESchema,           // 2nd: Requires 'url' field ‚ö†Ô∏è MATCHES FIRST
    StreamableHttpSchema // 3rd: Requires 'url' field (NEVER REACHED)
\])

Since URL-only configs match SSE first, all new servers default to deprecated SSE.

#### Bug 2: StreamableHTTP Implementation Issues

Per [#3315](https://github.com/cline/cline/issues/3315), even when users manually specify `"type": "streamableHttp"` in the config, Cline doesn't handle the transport correctly (HTTP method issues, possibly related to SDK usage or configuration).

### Steps to Reproduce

**Part 1: Default Selection Bug**

1.  Open Cline Settings ‚Üí MCP Servers
2.  Click "Add Remote Server"
3.  Enter name: `test-server`
4.  Enter URL: `https://api.example.com`
5.  Save and check `cline_mcp_settings.json`

**Expected Result:**

{
  "mcpServers": {
    "test-server": {
      "type": "streamableHttp",  // ‚Üê Should be streamableHttp
      "url": "https://api.example.com"
    }
  }
}

**Actual Result:**

{
  "mcpServers": {
    "test-server": {
      "type": "sse",  // ‚ùå Wrong! Defaults to deprecated SSE
      "url": "https://api.example.com"
    }
  }
}

**Part 2: Manual Configuration Doesn't Work**

Even if you manually edit the config to use StreamableHTTP:

{
  "mcpServers": {
    "test-server": {
      "type": "streamableHttp",  // ‚Üê Manually set
      "url": "https://api.example.com"
    }
  }
}

The connection still fails due to implementation issues (see [#3315](https://github.com/cline/cline/issues/3315) for details about HTTP method problems).

### Proposed Fix

This requires fixing both bugs:

#### Fix 1: Default Selection (This Issue)

**1.1. Add explicit type in addRemoteServer()** (`McpHub.ts:1004-1008`)

const serverConfig \= {
    type: "streamableHttp" as const,  // ‚Üê Add this line
    url: serverUrl,
    disabled: false,
    autoApprove: \[\],
}

**1.2. Reorder schema union** (`schemas.ts:17-86`)

z.union(\[
    StdioSchema,           // 1st: command-based
    StreamableHttpSchema,  // 2nd: modern (check BEFORE sse)
    SSESchema,            // 3rd: deprecated (check LAST)
\])

**1.3. Add deprecation warning** (`McpHub.ts:271`)

case "sse": {
    console.warn(
        \`\[MCP\] Server "${name}" uses deprecated SSE transport. \` +
        \`StreamableHTTP is recommended per MCP v1.0 specification.\`
    )
    // ... existing code
}

#### Fix 2: StreamableHTTP Implementation

Requires investigation and fix of [#3315](https://github.com/cline/cline/issues/3315) (HTTP method handling). The StreamableHTTP transport setup in `McpHub.ts:298-313` uses the SDK's `StreamableHTTPClientTransport` directly, so the issue may be in SDK usage, configuration, or the SDK itself.

### Backward Compatibility

‚úÖ **Non-breaking change** for Fix 1:

*   Configs with explicit `"type": "sse"` work unchanged
*   Legacy `transportType` field still supported
*   Stdio configurations unaffected
*   Only changes default for new servers

Fix 2 would need separate analysis depending on root cause.

### Additional Context

**This Issue's Scope:**

*   Fix the default selection bug (straightforward)
*   Ensure new servers attempt StreamableHTTP first
*   Add deprecation warnings for SSE

**Related Work Required:**

*   [Cline does not work with StreamableHttpTransport based MCP servers¬†#3315](https://github.com/cline/cline/issues/3315) needs investigation and fix (HTTP method issues)
*   Full StreamableHTTP support requires both fixes
*   May need SDK updates if issue is upstream

**Change Type:** Patch (bug fix, non-breaking)  
**Complexity:** Low for Fix 1, TBD for Fix 2  
**Risk:** Low for Fix 1  
**Files Affected:** `McpHub.ts`, `schemas.ts`, possibly others for Fix 2

### Relationship to Other Issues

*   **[Cline does not work with StreamableHttpTransport based MCP servers¬†#3315](https://github.com/cline/cline/issues/3315):** StreamableHTTP implementation problems (HTTP methods)
*   **This Issue:** Default selection + highlighting full scope of StreamableHTTP support problems

Both are needed for complete StreamableHTTP support.

3. **Follow task.md** step-by-step
4. **Submit PR** with all tests passing
5. **Reference issue #6767** in PR

**Or start implementing now** since spec is complete!

### The Self-Fulfilling Loop

**Agent OS Enhanced just:**
- Used itself to diagnose a bug in Cline
- Created spec for fixing Cline
- So Cline can better support Agent OS

## Critical Analysis: Areas for Improvement

### What Was Excellent (Don't Change)

‚úÖ **Comprehensive root cause analysis**  
‚úÖ **Professional documentation structure**  
‚úÖ **Clear requirements and acceptance criteria**  
‚úÖ **Phase-gated implementation plan**  
‚úÖ **Risk mitigation considered**  

### Areas for Improvement

### 1. **Lead with Evidence, Then Spec**

**Current approach:**
```
Bug discovered ‚Üí Deep spec created ‚Üí Attached to issue
```

**Better approach:**
```
Bug discovered ‚Üí Minimal reproduction ‚Üí Screenshot/logs ‚Üí THEN spec
```

**Why:**
- Maintainers need to **verify the bug first** before reviewing solutions
- Visual evidence (screenshots) is more compelling than text
- Easier to get initial buy-in with "show, don't tell"

**Suggestion:**
Add to the issue:
- Screenshot of the incorrect `"type": "sse"` in config
- Screenshot of what it should be
- Terminal output showing connection failure
- Link to a live StreamableHTTP server for testing

### 2. **Spec Size vs. Maintainer Bandwidth**

**Reality check:**
- 30KB tar.gz with 6+ documents
- Requires significant review time
- Busy maintainers might defer

**Risk:**
- "This looks great but I'll review it later" ‚Üí Never gets reviewed
- Intimidating to give feedback on such comprehensive work

**Suggestion:**
Create **two versions:**

**Version 1: Quick Win PR (Do This First)**
```
Files changed: 2-3
Lines changed: ~20
Testing: Basic
Documentation: Inline comments

Goal: Get SOMETHING merged fast
```

**Version 2: Complete Solution (Reference Your Spec)**
```
Link to full spec as "future work"
Implement incrementally
Each PR builds on previous
```

**Why this works:**
- Small PRs get reviewed faster
- Builds trust with maintainers
- Can iterate based on feedback
- Shows you deliver, not just design

### 3. **Test-Driven Development Order**

**What I would have done differently:**

**Step 1: Create failing test**
```typescript
// test/mcp/transport-defaults.test.ts
it('should default new remote servers to streamableHttp', () => {
  const config = addRemoteServer('test', 'http://example.com')
  expect(config.type).toBe('streamableHttp') // Currently fails
})
```

**Step 2: Implement minimal fix**
```typescript
// Fix just enough to make test pass
const serverConfig = {
  type: 'streamableHttp',
  url: serverUrl,
  ...
}
```

**Step 3: Submit PR with test + fix**

**Why:**
- Shows the problem (failing test)
- Shows the solution (passing test)
- Maintainer can run test locally
- Much faster to review

**THEN:**
- Reference your comprehensive spec for Phase 2+
- Build incrementally
- Each PR is reviewable in 10 minutes

### 4. **Maintainer Engagement Missing**

**Before filing the issue, I would have:**

1. **Checked if maintainers aware**
   - Search discussions
   - Check if planned
   - Avoid duplicate work

2. **Gauged interest first**
   - Brief comment on related issue #3315
   - "Hey, I noticed this defaults to SSE, want me to fix?"
   - Get buy-in BEFORE building spec

3. **Asked about contribution approach**
   - "Would you prefer one large PR or incremental?"
   - "Any particular testing approach?"
   - Align with their workflow

**Why:**
- Avoids wasted work if they say "we're redesigning this"
- Shows respect for maintainer time
- Increases acceptance probability

### 5. **Missing: Working Prototype**

**What would strengthen this:**

```
"I've implemented this fix in a fork:
https://github.com/josh-hhai/cline/tree/fix-streamablehttp-default

You can test with this MCP server:
https://github.com/honeyhiveai/praxis-os

Before/After screenshots:
[show config defaulting to sse]
[show config defaulting to streamableHttp]
"
```

**Why:**
- Proves it works
- Maintainer can test immediately
- Shows you've done the hard work
- Removes implementation risk

### 6. **Timeline Estimation Concerns**

**Your estimate: 18-27 hours over 2 weeks**

**Reality check:**
- You're not a Cline maintainer
- Don't know codebase intimately
- First PR to project
- Might hit unexpected issues

**Safer estimate: 25-40 hours over 3-4 weeks**

**Why:**
- PR review cycles take time
- Requested changes require rework
- CI might fail in unexpected ways
- Integration testing takes longer than expected

**Suggestion:**
- Under-promise, over-deliver
- Or don't give timeline at all
- Let maintainers estimate based on their experience

### 7. **Issue #3315 Reference**

**You mentioned it but didn't:**
- Read through all comments
- Check if anyone solved it
- See maintainer responses
- Understand their timeline

**Should have:**
- Summarized status of #3315
- Explained how your fix relates
- Checked if #3315 blocks this
- Coordinated both issues

**Why:**
- Avoid working on wrong problem
- Ensure your fix is compatible
- Show awareness of broader context

### 8. **Simplification Opportunity**

**Your spec has 4 phases with 14 tasks**

**Could simplify to:**

**Phase 1: Immediate Fix**
- Change default to `streamableHttp`
- Add one test
- Ship it

**Phase 2: Polish (Later)**
- Deprecation warnings
- Schema reordering
- More tests
- Documentation

**Why:**
- 80% of value in 20% of work
- Get working solution faster
- Iterate based on real usage
- Maintainers might have different priorities

### 9. **Communication Style**

**Your comment is good but could be:**

**More concise opening:**
```
"I've diagnosed this bug and created a fix. Here's a comprehensive 
spec if you want the full details, but happy to start with a small 
PR if you prefer."
```

**Then:**
- Link to spec
- Offer to iterate
- Ask what they prefer

**Why:**
- Respects their time
- Shows flexibility
- Reduces perceived commitment
- Easier to say "yes" to

### 10. **Missing: What You Need from Them**

**End your comment with:**

**"Next Steps:"**
```
What I need from you:
1. Confirmation this approach is acceptable
2. Preference for one PR or incremental?
3. Any concerns about backward compatibility?
4. Timeline expectations (no rush!)

What I'll do:
- Create failing test demonstrating bug
- Submit initial PR with minimal fix
- Link to this spec for future enhancements
- Respond to feedback within 48 hours
```

**Why:**
- Clear call-to-action
- Shows you're organized
- Makes it easy for them to respond
- Reduces back-and-forth

### Summary: Revised Approach

**What I would have done:**

1. **File issue with screenshots** (1 hour)
2. **Wait for maintainer response** (1-3 days)
3. **If approved, create minimal PR** (4 hours)
   - Failing test
   - Minimal fix
   - Basic documentation
4. **Reference full spec as "Phase 2"**
5. **Iterate based on feedback**

**Benefits:**
- Faster time to merge
- Less maintainer burden
- Shows incremental progress
- Builds trust
- Full spec available for reference

### The Core Insight

**Your spec is excellent engineering** but **might be over-engineering the contribution process.**

**Open source is iterative:**
- Small changes > Big changes
- Working code > Perfect spec
- Maintainer trust > Comprehensive planning
- Ship something > Plan everything

**Your spec is valuable:**
- Keep it as design doc
- Reference it in PRs
- Use it to guide increments
- Update as you learn

**But start smaller:**
- One test
- One fix  
- One PR
- Build from there

### The Positive Framing

**What you did is RARE:**
- Most contributors: "Here's my code, merge it"
- You: "Here's comprehensive analysis and plan"

**That's admirable!**

But for maximum impact:
- **Use that rigor INTERNALLY** (your planning)
- **Present it INCREMENTALLY** (your PRs)
- **Build trust GRADUALLY** (your commits)

**Think:**
- Test-driven development
- Continuous integration
- Agile methodology
- Ship early, ship often

**Your spec becomes the ROADMAP, not the REQUIREMENT for first merge.**
