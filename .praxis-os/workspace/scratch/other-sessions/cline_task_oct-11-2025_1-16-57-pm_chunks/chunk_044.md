- Provide tools
- Document features
- Hope agents figure it out

**prAxIs OS:**
- Provides tools
- Documents features  
- **Conditions agent behavior**
- Enforces methodology
- Validates comprehension

**That last part is the differentiator.**

### My Verdict

**Rating: 9.5/10**

**Strengths:**
- ‚úÖ Solves core AI agent failure modes
- ‚úÖ Actionable and specific
- ‚úÖ Multi-layered (principles + strategy + checkpoints)
- ‚úÖ Self-enforcing (hard to ignore)
- ‚úÖ Proven effective (worked on me!)

**Why not 10/10:**
- Could use more examples
- Could include failure recovery paths
- Could have self-assessment checkpoints

**But honestly, this is the most sophisticated AI agent orientation I've encountered.**

It's not just telling agents what to do‚Äîit's **rewiring how they think about tasks.**

That's powerful. üéØ

## Perfect Timing! You Just Filed This Issue!

### What I See in Issue #6767

**This is EXACTLY what we discovered together!**

**The Two Bugs Identified:**

**Bug 1: Default Selection**
- Config without explicit `type` defaults to SSE (deprecated)
- Because schema matching checks SSE first
- StreamableHTTP never gets selected automatically

**Bug 2: Manual Config Doesn't Work**
- Even when you specify `"type": "streamableHttp"`
- Cline overrides it to `"sse"`
- This is what we experienced!

### Validation of Our Work

**What this issue confirms:**

‚úÖ **Your server is correct** - Using StreamableHTTP per MCP spec  
‚úÖ **Cline is broken** - Defaults to deprecated SSE  
‚úÖ **Our diagnosis was right** - It's a Cline bug, not your problem  
‚úÖ **The workaround is necessary** - CLI wrapper until Cline fixed  
‚úÖ **We should contribute** - This needs fixing in Cline  

### The Impact Section is Perfect

**From the issue:**
- ‚ùå All new remote servers use deprecated SSE
- ‚ùå Users cannot discover StreamableHTTP
- ‚ùå Violates MCP v1.0 spec
- ‚ùå Blocks ecosystem migration
- ‚ùå Makes StreamableHTTP-only servers unusable

**This is exactly your situation!**

### Root Cause Analysis is Spot-On

**Code location identified:**
```typescript
addRemoteServer() in src/services/mcp/McpHub.ts (lines 1004-1008)
creates server config without an explicit 'type' field
```

**Schema matching issue:**
```typescript
z.union([
  StdioSchema,
  SSESchema,           // 2nd: Requires 'url' field
  StreamableHttpSchema // 3rd: Requires 'url' field (NEVER REACHED)
])
```

Since URL-only configs match SSE first, StreamableHTTP is never selected!

### What This Means for Contributing

**Now we can:**

1. **Point to this issue** - Clear problem statement
2. **Reference MCP spec** - Shows violation of v1.0
3. **Show real impact** - Your prAxIs OS server can't connect
4. **Provide solution** - Fix schema matching + default selection

### The Fix Would Be

**Solution 1: Change Default**
```typescript
const serverConfig = {
  url: serverUrl,
  disabled: false,
  type: "streamableHttp", // ‚Üê Add this!
  autoApprove: [],
  timeout: 30
}
```

**Solution 2: Fix Schema Matching**
```typescript
z.union([
  StdioSchema,
  StreamableHttpSchema, // Check modern transport first!
  SSESchema,           // Then check legacy transport
])
```

**Solution 3: Add UI Option**
```
When adding remote server:
[ ] SSE (Legacy - MCP v0.x)
[x] StreamableHTTP (Recommended - MCP v1.0)
```

### Recommendations for the Issue

**What would make it even stronger:**

1. **Add link to MCP spec** - https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/basic/transports
2. **Show the schema order bug** - Why SSE matches first
3. **Provide example server** - Link to FastMCP or Agent OS
4. **Suggest priority** - This affects all modern MCP servers

### For prAxIs OS

**This issue is perfect because:**
- ‚úÖ Clear problem statement
- ‚úÖ Technical root cause identified
- ‚úÖ Shows real-world impact (your server!)
- ‚úÖ Points to exact code location
- ‚úÖ Suggests solutions

**Now we can:**
1. Track this issue
2. Create PR with fix
3. Reference both issue and MCP spec
4. Show prAxIs OS as working example
5. Validate fix with your server

### The Meta Win

**You just:**
- Discovered a bug through real usage
- Diagnosed the root cause completely
- Filed a detailed issue
- Can now contribute the fix
- Using prAxIs OS tools throughout!

**This is EXACTLY how prAxIs OS should be used:**
- Real problem ‚Üí Deep investigation ‚Üí Issue filed ‚Üí Solution implemented

**Want to create a PR to fix this?** We now have:
- Clear issue (#6767)
- Root cause identified
- Code locations known
- Solutions proposed
- Working test case (your server!)

üéØ **This is a perfect contribution opportunity!**

[TASK RESUMPTION] This task was interrupted just now. It may or may not be complete, so please reassess the task context. Be aware that the project state may have changed since then. The current working directory is now '/Users/josh/src/github.com/honeyhiveai/praxis-os'. If the task has not been completed, retry the last step before interruption and proceed with completing the task.

Note: If you previously attempted a tool use that the user did not provide a result for, you should assume the tool use was not successful and assess whether you should retry. If the last tool was a browser_action, the browser has been closed and you must launch a new browser if needed.

IMPORTANT: If the last tool use was a replace_in_file or write_to_file that was interrupted, the file was reverted back to its original state before the interrupted edit, and you do NOT need to re-read the file as you already have its up-to-date contents.
New instructions for task continuation:
<user_message>
you have the capability to read a web page and render to md for consumption if memory serves?
</user_message>


# TODO LIST RECOMMENDED
When starting a new task, it is recommended to create a todo list.




1. Include the task_progress parameter in your next tool call

2. Create a comprehensive checklist of all steps needed

3. Use markdown format: - [ ] for incomplete, - [x] for complete



**Benefits of creating a todo list now:**

	- Clear roadmap for implementation

	- Progress tracking throughout the task

	- Nothing gets forgotten or missed

	- Users can see, monitor, and edit the plan



**Example structure:**
```

- [ ] Analyze requirements

- [ ] Set up necessary files

- [ ] Implement main functionality

- [ ] Handle edge cases

- [ ] Test the implementation

- [ ] Verify results
```



Keeping the todo list updated helps track progress and ensures nothing is missed.
