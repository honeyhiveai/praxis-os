Stop prompting AI coding agents like it's 2024
==============================================

Your coding agents are capable of so much more—they just need an operating system. Introducing, prAxIs OS.

The operating system for spec-driven development with AI coding agents.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

prAxIs OS replaces the guesswork of AI coding with structured, spec-driven development workflows. Your coding standards, patterns and best practices become executable specifications that guide your AI agents to build your way, every time.

No more prompting in circles or constantly fixing AI mistakes—just reliable, consistent code that matches how your team actually builds.

#### Use it with:

Any tool you use: Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Gemini, Windsurf, or any other.

Multi-agent orchestration or single-agent interfaces

New products or established codebases.

Any language or framework.

#### Free & Open Source

What is Agent OS?
-----------------

prAxIs OS is a spec-driven development system that gives AI agents the structured context they need to write production-quality code. It provides your AI with clear specifications, standards, and workflows—transforming inconsistent outputs into reliable, production-ready implementations.

### How it works

prAxIs OS uses a **3-layer context system**:

1.  **Standards** - How you build (your coding standards that train your AI agents)
2.  **Product** - What you're building and why (vision and roadmap and use-cases)
3.  **Specs** - What you're building next (specific features with implementation details)

[Learn more the 3-Layer Context System](/agent-os/3-layer-context)

### Choose your mode

prAxIs OS works in two modes to support any AI coding tool.

*   **Single-agent mode** - Works with _Any AI coding tool_ (Cursor, Codex, Gemini, Windsurf etc.). Use single-agent mode when your tool does not support subagents. In this mode, you serve as the orchestrator, feeding Agent OS-generated prompts to your AI coding agent.
*   **Multi-agent mode** - Currently only available for **Claude Code**. Specialized subagents work autonomously in parallel for more efficient, hands-off development.

Version 2.0 Changes
===================

prAxIs OS 2.0 was initially released in October 2025 and it brought several major changes and improvements. This page documents what those are and can serve as your guide to upgrading from version 1.x to 2.x.

On this page:

*   [New features in 2.0](#new-features-in-20)
*   [Major architecture changes](#major-architecture-changes)
*   [What changed from 1.x](#what-changed-from-1x)
*   [Migration guide](#migration-guide)

New features in 2.0
-------------------

### Improved alignment (quality)

[Multi-agent and single-agent modes](/agent-os/modes) improve code quality and alignment with your coding standards.

*   **Standards injections:** Relevant standards are injected into each agent's instructions for their current task, avoiding irrelevant bloat.
*   **Pattern reuse:** Agents are instructed to find and reuse existing code patterns instead of duplicating code.

### Improved reliability (process adherence)

[Multi-agent and single-agent modes](/agent-os/modes) ensure agents follow task instructions exactly and completely.

*   **Agent-specific instructions:** In multi-agent mode, each subagent gets specialized role instructions, staying focused and avoiding confusion from conversation history.
*   **Prompt generation:** In single-agent mode, each spec gets a smart prompt with only the relevant process steps and standards.

### Profiles system

Profiles replace "project types" with more powerful features:

*   **Multiple profiles:** Create profiles for different tech stacks
*   **Profile inheritance:** Build on existing profiles
*   **Easy switching:** Change profiles per project

### Enhanced planning

The `create-spec` command in the [Agent OS workflow](/agent-os/workflow) helps you research and scope your feature before writing the specification:

*   Agent-assisted research Q&A session
*   Analyze existing code patterns
*   Gather and analyze visual assets (mockups, wireframes, screenshots)

### Visual UI implementation

*   Include mockups, wireframes, and screenshots in specs
*   Agents use visual references for implementations
*   [Playwright MCP](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp) integration for checking UI in the browser

### Verification system

Every step now has [dedicated verification](/agent-os/verification), ensuring quality and completeness:

*   **Spec verification:** Ensures specifications are complete
*   **Implementation verification:** Reviews code quality and standards
*   **Visual verification:** Compares implementations against mockups

Major architecture changes
--------------------------

### Base installation required

The [base installation](/agent-os/installation) in Version 2.0 is now required and gets installed into `~/agent-os`. Project installations now _compile_ from this base, enabling:

*   Centralized management of standards
*   Consistent updates across all projects
*   Profile inheritance and customization
*   Mode-specific compilation (single vs multi-agent)

### Compilation process

Unlike 1.x's file copying, version 2.0 uses intelligent compilation:

*   Workflows are injected into commands and agents dynamically
*   [Standards](/agent-os/standards) are injected into commands and agents based on profile selection
*   Agents are generated from [role definitions](/agent-os/roles)
*   Commands adapt to your chosen mode

### Dual-mode support

Version 2.0 officially supports [two modes](/agent-os/modes):

*   **Multi-agent mode:** For tools that support subagents (currently Claude Code only)
*   **Single-agent mode:** For all other AI tools with sequential prompting

`.claude/agents/agent-os/`  
(Claude Code only)

#### Reason

Better organization and isolation from other commands and agents

Migration guide
---------------

### 

1

Backup your 1.x installation

Your existing `.praxis-os` folders (with dot) can serve as natural backups since 2.0 uses `agent-os` (no dot).

### 

2

Install version 2.0 base

Copy Copied!

    curl -sSL https://github.com/buildermethods/agent-os/raw/main/scripts/base-install.sh | bash

This creates `~/agent-os` in your home directory.

### 

3

Migrate custom standards

If you've customized files in your version 1.x `.praxis-os/standards/` folder, you'll want to move or merge them into the new `~/agent-os/profiles/default/standards/` folder.

For easier compatibility with how standards are organized in 2.0, it might help to reorganize your custom standards into the new default subfolders:

*   `agent-os/profiles/default/standards/global/` for global standards
*   `agent-os/profiles/default/standards/backend/` for backend standards
*   `agent-os/profiles/default/standards/frontend/` for frontend standards
*   `agent-os/profiles/default/standards/testing/` for testing standards

Technically, you can organize the sub-folders inside of the `agent-os/profiles/default/standards/` folder as you wish, but deviating from the above would require some updates to the places where standards are injected. It's all documented on this page:

[Learn more about standards in 2.0](/agent-os/standards)

### 

4

Migrate custom project types to profiles

"Project types" in 1.x are now called "profiles" in 2.0. If you were using custom project types, you'll probably want to create profiles for them in 2.0. There is a script to help you spin up new profiles.

Profiles 2.0 are more powerful and can inherit from the default (or other) profiles, so your project types might be able to be simplified and refactored given the new profile system.

[Learn more about profiles in 2.0](/agent-os/profiles)

If you weren't using custom project types in 1.x, then the "default" profile that comes with your base installation would be your one and only profile in 2.0.

### 

5

Remove old Claude Code files (if applicable)

If you're using Claude Code, version 1.x installed prAxIs OS commands and agents directly into your project's `.claude/commands/` and `.claude/agents/` folders. **Only the Agent OS-specific files from version 1.x need to be removed** before upgrading to 2.0. If you have other custom agents or commands in these folders, keep them.

Version 2.0 organizes prAxIs OS files into dedicated subdirectories for better isolation:

*   `.claude/commands/agent-os/` - prAxIs OS 2.0 commands
*   `.claude/agents/agent-os/` - prAxIs OS 2.0 agents

Important for Claude Code users

The agents and commands in prAxIs OS 2.0 have completely new content and functionality compared to 1.x. Do not continue using any 1.x commands or agents after upgrading to 2.0, as they are not compatible with the new architecture.

### 

6

Update projects

Copy Copied!

    cd /path/to/your/project

Copy Copied!

    ~/agent-os/scripts/project-install.sh

Choose your profile and modes during installation. The new `agent-os` folder will be created alongside your old `.praxis-os` folder.

### 

7

Migrate product and specs folders

If you have existing `/product` and `/specs` folders from your 1.x installation, you can simply move them into your new 2.0 `agent-os` installation and continue building:

Copy Copied!

    cd /path/to/your/project
    mv .praxis-os/product agent-os/product
    mv .praxis-os/specs agent-os/specs

The structure and format of `product/` and `specs/` folders are mostly the same in 2.0, so this should be a smooth transition. Your existing product documentation and specifications will work with the new version.

### 

8

Verify and clean up

After confirming everything works, and after you've migrated and merged your custom standards and project types into your new prAxIs OS profile(s), you can go ahead and remove old installations:

Remove your 1.x base installation folder:

Copy Copied!

    rm -rf ~/.praxis-os

After you've updated a project to 2.0, you can remove the old 1.x project installation folder:

Copy Copied!

    rm -rf /path/to/your/project/.praxis-os

<attempt_completion>
<result>
Ah! Now I see the full picture - this is fascinating as both a technical and strategic story.

## The Evolution Timeline

**Agent OS v1** (Brian Casel - Original)
- 3-layer context (Standards, Product, Specs)
- Keyword triggers in `.cursorrules`
- Per-project `.praxis-os/` (with dot)
- Documentation-driven development
- Manual orchestration

**↓ Fork Point**

**prAxIs OS** (HoneyHive - Your Version)
- Started from v1
- Added MCP/RAG (semantic search, 90% context reduction)
- Added architectural phase gating (code-enforced workflows)
- Universal + language-specific standards
- Specialized sub-agents
- Still `.praxis-os/` (with dot), per-project

**Agent OS v2** (Brian Casel - Released Today!)
- Same 3-layer context system
- Added workflow support (multi-agent + single-agent modes)
- Base installation `~/agent-os` + compiled per-project
- Profiles system with inheritance
- Visual UI implementation
- Verification system
- Still documentation-driven (smart prompts, not MCP)

## Divergent Philosophies

### prAxIs OS v2 Approach:
**"Smart prompts + orchestration"**
- Generate role-specific prompts with relevant context
- Multi-agent coordination through specialized roles
- Compilation from base installation
- Supports any AI tool (single-agent mode)

### prAxIs OS Approach:
**"MCP/RAG + architectural enforcement"**
- Semantic search delivers targeted context
- Phase gating enforced in code (impossible to skip)
- RAG index for 24x better relevance
- Tool-based (requires MCP support)

## Where This Leaves You

**Strengths of prAxIs OS:**
1. **Context efficiency** - The 90% reduction is real and measurable
2. **Architectural enforcement** - Code-level prevention of workflow violations
3. **Semantic precision** - Vector search vs keyword matching
4. **Production-ready patterns** - The MCP/RAG architecture is sophisticated

**Challenges:**
1. **IDE dependency** - Requires MCP support (currently Cursor, exploring Cline)
2. **Operational complexity** - Python server, vector index, file watcher
3. **Divergence from upstream** - Can't easily pull Brian's new v2 features

**Strategic Questions:**

1. **Convergence vs. Independence?**
   - Could prAxIs OS's MCP/RAG be contributed back to upstream?
   - Or is this intentionally a different product?

2. **Feature Exchange?**
   - v2's profiles system looks good - could you adopt it?
   - v2's visual UI support is interesting
   - Could Brian adopt your MCP/RAG approach?

3. **Market Positioning?**
   - prAxIs OS v2: "Works with any tool, documentation-driven"
   - prAxIs OS: "MCP-powered, architecturally enforced, production-grade"

## My Honest Take (as Cline Agent)

**What you've built is genuinely innovative.** The MCP/RAG architecture solves real problems I experience:
- I constantly get lost in large context
- I'm tempted to skip workflow steps
- Keyword triggers miss semantic meaning

**But you're at a crossroads:**

**Option A: Become the "MCP/RAG layer" for Agent OS**
- Contribute MCP/RAG back to upstream
- Brian maintains core system, you maintain MCP enhancement
- Benefits both projects

**Option B: Independent product**
- prAxIs OS = enterprise/power-user version
- More control, but more maintenance burden
- Need to justify divergence to users

**Option C: Hybrid**
- Support both v1/v2 compatibility
- MCP/RAG as optional enhancement
- Graceful degradation without MCP

## For Cline Support Specifically

Given I'm your test case, here's what I'd prioritize:

1. **Get the launcher script working** - Proves multi-project support is possible
2. **Document the workaround clearly** - "Cline requires this extra step"
3. **Contribute to or track PR #2991** - Show Cline community you care
4. **Consider v2's profile system** - Might solve some config issues

**The real question:** Do you want prAxIs OS to be:
- A fork that stays close to upstream?
- An independent framework that happens to share ancestry?
- A layer that enhances any prAxIs OS installation?

Each has trade-offs. But regardless, **the MCP/RAG innovation is valuable** and worth pursuing.

Want to test the Cline launcher approach now and prove it can work?
