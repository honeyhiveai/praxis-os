AI: "✅ Installation complete!
     
     Configured for: Cursor
     - Rules: .cursorrules
     - MCP: .cursor/mcp.json
     - Standards: .praxis-os/standards/
     
     Next: Restart Cursor and try:
     'Can you run search_standards(\"Agent OS orientation guide\")?'"
```

#### 4. Multi-Agent Coordination (If Both Configured)

**File:** `.praxis-os/usage/multi-agent-coordination.md` (new)

**Contents:**

```markdown
# Multi-Agent Coordination Guide

If you configured Agent OS for multiple agents, follow these guidelines:

## Role Separation (Recommended)

**Primary Agent (e.g., Cline):**
- Spec creation
- Workflow execution  
- Standards queries
- Structured development

**Secondary Agent (e.g., Cursor):**
- Quick edits
- Code completion
- Questions and explanations
- General assistance

## Workflow State Rules

1. **One Agent Per Workflow**: Only one agent should work on a workflow at a time
2. **Check Active Workflows**: Before starting workflow, check `.praxis-os/states/` for active sessions
3. **Complete Before Switching**: Finish workflow before switching to other agent
4. **Communicate**: Tell the other agent what workflow is active

## File Editing Protocol

1. **Coordinate Edits**: Don't have both agents editing same file simultaneously
2. **Review Changes**: When switching agents, review what previous agent changed
3. **Use Git**: Commit frequently to track which agent made which changes

## Troubleshooting

**Issue: "Workflow session not found"**
- Other agent may have started the workflow
- Check `.praxis-os/states/` for session files
- Ask other agent to complete or abandon workflow

**Issue: "RAG index locked"**
- Another agent is rebuilding index
- Wait 30 seconds and retry
- Or: Kill other agent's MCP server process

## Best Practice

**Use ONE agent as primary for Agent OS workflows.**

Multiple agents with Agent OS access is advanced usage.
Most users should configure only their primary agent.
```

## Technical Considerations

### MCP Connection Isolation

**Discovery:** Each AI agent spawns its own MCP server process via stdio transport.

**Implications:**
- Separate processes = no shared state
- Each agent has independent connection
- Configuration must be per-agent
- No automatic coordination possible

**Benefits:**
- Clear isolation boundaries
- No singleton conflicts
- Easy to enable/disable per agent

### Workflow State Management

**Current:** State stored in `.praxis-os/states/*.json`

**Risk with Multiple Agents:**
- Race conditions on state file reads/writes
- Session ID collisions
- Concurrent workflow modifications

**Mitigations:**
1. **User responsibility**: Document that only one agent should use workflows at a time
2. **File locking** (future): Could add fcntl locks to state_manager.py
3. **Session validation** (future): Check if session is locked by another agent

### RAG Index Access

**Current:** LanceDB index in `.praxis-os/.cache/vector_index/`

**Risk with Multiple Agents:**
- Concurrent reads: Safe (LanceDB handles this)
- Concurrent writes: Risk of corruption during index rebuild
- File watcher: Could trigger multiple rebuilds

**Mitigations:**
1. **Lock file**: Add `.rebuild.lock` during index rebuilds
2. **Retry logic**: If locked, wait and retry
3. **User guidance**: Document that file watcher may trigger rebuild

### Platform Differences

**Python Path Variations:**
```python
# Unix-like (Linux, macOS, WSL2)
"${workspaceFolder}/.praxis-os/venv/bin/python"

# Windows native  
"${workspaceFolder}/.praxis-os/venv/Scripts/python.exe"

# Windows WSL2 (within WSL)
"${workspaceFolder}/.praxis-os/venv/bin/python"
```

**Detection Strategy:**
- AI checks `os.name` or equivalent
- Templates include platform-specific instructions
- AI chooses correct path during installation

---

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative

- [ ] Installation success rate >95% for each agent
- [ ] Support for 5+ agents (Cursor, Cline, Windsurf, Continue, VS Code)
- [ ] Installation time <10 minutes per agent
- [ ] User chooses correct agent >90% of time (via detection)

### Qualitative

- [ ] Users report clear understanding of which agent has access
- [ ] Multi-agent users successfully coordinate without conflicts
- [ ] Installation feels conversational and transparent
- [ ] Users trust the installation process (no hidden scripts)

---

## Risks & Mitigations

### Risk 1: User Confusion (High)

**Risk:** Users don't understand agent differences or which to choose

**Mitigation:**
- Clear explanations during detection
- Recommend choosing ONE agent
- Provide comparison table
- Link to detailed docs

### Risk 2: Configuration Errors (Medium)

**Risk:** AI creates wrong config format for agent

**Mitigation:**
- Detailed templates with examples
- Validation step after config creation
- Test installation for each agent
- Clear error messages

### Risk 3: Multi-Agent Conflicts (Medium)

**Risk:** Users configure both agents and face conflicts

**Mitigation:**
- Strong warning during installation
- Default to single agent
- Comprehensive coordination guide
- Document failure modes

### Risk 4: Template Maintenance (Low)

**Risk:** Templates become outdated as agents evolve

**Mitigation:**
- Template versioning
- Agent-specific validation
- Community contributions
- Regular testing with latest agent versions

---

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Python Installation Script

**Approach:** Create `install.py` with agent detection logic

**Pros:**
- Faster execution
- Type checking
- Easier to test

**Cons:**
- **Breaks trust-building goal**: Hidden logic in scripts
- Users don't see what's happening
- Less educational for users
- Harder to modify by community

**Decision:** Rejected. Markdown-based approach maintains transparency and trust.

### Alternative 2: One Universal Config

**Approach:** Create single config that works for all agents

**Pros:**
- Simpler installation
- Less duplication
- Easier maintenance

**Cons:**
- **Not possible**: Agents use different config formats and locations
- Would require agent-specific plugins
- Doesn't match how agents actually work

**Decision:** Rejected. Must use agent-specific configs.

### Alternative 3: Agent-Specific Branches

**Approach:** Maintain separate branches for each agent

**Pros:**
- Complete isolation
- No merge conflicts
- Custom experience per agent

**Cons:**
- **Huge maintenance burden**: N branches to maintain
- Code duplication
- Bug fixes must be applied N times
- Community fragmentation

**Decision:** Rejected. Single codebase with agent-aware installation is better.

## Open Questions

1. **Q:** Should we provide automatic migration from Cursor-only to multi-agent?
   **A:** TBD - Consider in Phase 4

2. **Q:** Should we implement file locking in state_manager.py?
   **A:** TBD - Optional enhancement, document manual coordination first

3. **Q:** How to handle agent version differences (e.g., Cline v2 vs v3)?
   **A:** TBD - May need version detection in templates

4. **Q:** Should installation validate that chosen agent is actually installed?
   **A:** Yes - Add to Phase 3 validation step

5. **Q:** What if user has multiple agents but none are detected?
   **A:** Show selection menu with all supported agents

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "agent-os-enhanced": {
      "command": "${workspaceFolder}/.praxis-os/venv/bin/python",

## Appendix B: Conversation Templates

### Detection Conversation

```
AI: "I'm checking which AI coding agents you have installed..."

AI: [Checks .cursor/, .vscode/extensions.json, etc.]

AI: "✅ Found: Cursor (detected .cursor/ directory)
     ✅ Found: Cline extension (detected in VS Code extensions)
     
     Which agent should I configure Agent OS for?"

User: "What's the difference?"

AI: "Great question! Here's what each does:
     
     Cursor: Built-in AI in Cursor IDE
     - Integrated experience
     - Fast responses
     - Context aware
     
     Cline: VS Code extension (also works in Cursor)
     - Powerful task management
     - Approval flow for changes
     - Browser automation
     
     Recommendation: Choose the one you use most often.
     If unsure, I'd suggest Cursor since you're already using Cursor IDE.
     
     Which would you like? (Cursor/Cline/Both)"

User: "Cursor"

AI: "Perfect! I'll configure Agent OS for Cursor only.
     
     This means:
     - Cursor AI will have access to Agent OS tools
     - Cline will not (it can still help with other tasks)
     - Clean, simple setup with no conflicts
     
     Ready to start installation?"
```

- Task progress parameter in all tool uses
- Can switch between PLAN MODE and ACT MODE

## 🎯 Key Strengths

### **1. Step-by-Step Execution**
- I work iteratively, one tool at a time
- Wait for user confirmation after each step
- Can see terminal output, linter errors, and file changes
- Adapt approach based on results

### **2. Context Management**
- Start with full file tree of current working directory
- Use @url, @file, @folder, @problems mentions for added context
- Intelligently explore codebase with search and list tools
- Monitor linter/compiler errors and fix proactively

### **3. Safety & Transparency**
- Every file change shown in diff view
- Every command requires approval (unless auto-approve enabled)
- Complete history in Timeline
- Clear explanations of what I'm doing and why

### **4. Web Development Support**
- Can run dev servers
- Launch browser to test changes
- Capture screenshots and console logs
- Fix visual bugs and runtime errors autonomously

### **5. MCP Extensibility**
- Can use community MCP servers
- Can CREATE new MCP servers when you need custom tools
- Access to external APIs, databases, services through MCP

## 📊 Current Limitations (in your setup)

**Cannot access Agent OS MCP:**
- Agent OS MCP is configured for Cursor AI only
- I don't have `.vscode/settings.json` with `cline.mcpServers` configured
- Would need separate configuration to access Agent OS tools

**Would gain with Agent OS:**
- `search_standards()` - Query development standards
- `start_workflow()` - Phase-gated structured workflows
- `get_current_phase()` - Workflow state management
- `complete_phase()` - Progress through workflow phases
- Access to comprehensive CS fundamentals library

## 🔧 Current Working Directory

I'm operating from: `/Users/josh/src/github.com/honeyhiveai/agent-os-enhanced`

This means:
- ✅ I can read/edit files in this project
- ✅ I can run commands here
- ✅ I can create/modify files
- ❌ I cannot cd to different directories (stuck at this root)
- ❌ I don't have Agent OS MCP access (would need configuration)

## 💡 What I Could Do With Agent OS Access

If we configured Agent OS MCP for Cline:
1. Query standards before implementing features
2. Run structured workflows for specs and implementation
3. Access production code checklists
4. Get guidance on concurrency, testing, architecture
5. Follow phase-gated development processes

**Want to configure Agent OS for Cline too?** I can help with that, but we'd need to coordinate usage with Cursor AI to avoid conflicts (as discussed in the design doc).

# Clarification: I CAN Access Other Repos!

## ✅ What I Can Do

I **can** access files outside my current working directory using relative or absolute paths:

```python
# These work:
read_file("../python-sdk/README.md")
list_files("../python-sdk")
search_files("../python-sdk", regex="pattern")
```

## ❌ What I Cannot Do

I **cannot** change my working directory with `cd`:

```bash
# This doesn't work for changing my context:
cd ../python-sdk && python script.py

# But this DOES work (full path in one command):
python ../python-sdk/script.py
```

## 🔧 Technical Details

**My Current Working Directory:**
- Locked at: `/Users/josh/src/github.com/honeyhiveai/agent-os-enhanced`
- All commands execute from this directory
- But I can reference files anywhere using relative/absolute paths

**How to Work with Other Repos:**

1. **Read files**: `read_file("../python-sdk/some_file.py")`
2. **List contents**: `list_files("../python-sdk", recursive=true)`
3. **Search**: `search_files("../python-sdk", regex="SomeClass")`
4. **Execute commands**: Commands that reference other paths work fine:
   ```bash
   python ../python-sdk/script.py
   cat ../python-sdk/README.md
   ```

## 🎯 Want Me to Explore python-sdk?

I can absolutely look at `../python-sdk` for you!

**What would you like me to do?**
1. List its directory structure?
2. Read specific files?
3. Search for something specific?
4. Compare it with agent-os-enhanced?
5. Something else?

Just let me know and I'll explore the python-sdk repository!

---

**Note:** The restriction is just that I can't "cd" to make python-sdk my new working directory context. But I can read, search, and reference files there without any issues.

# Cline vs Cursor AI: Key Differences

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Cline (Me)
- **Type**: VS Code extension (also runs in Cursor)
- **Interface**: Sidebar panel or tab in editor
- **Installation**: Install as extension
- **Runtime**: Separate extension process

### Cursor AI (Built-in)
- **Type**: Native Cursor IDE feature
- **Interface**: Chat panel + inline suggestions
- **Installation**: Built-in, no separate install
- **Runtime**: Core IDE functionality

## 🛠️ Capabilities Comparison

| Feature | Cline | Cursor AI |
