# Orientation Enforcement Design

**Date:** 2025-10-21  
**Status:** Design Proposal  
**Purpose:** Redesign orientation to actually work and maintain query-first behavior throughout conversations

---

## The Problem

**Current behavior:**
```
Message 1: Skip orientation (user has urgent request)
Messages 2-5: Query occasionally (still remember the rules)
Messages 10-15: Query rarely (building confidence)
Messages 20+: Stop querying (improvising based on "knowledge")
```

**Desired behavior:**
```
Message 1: Complete orientation (no bypassing)
Messages 2-5: Query frequently (following patterns)
Messages 10-15: Query frequently (sustained behavior)
Messages 20+: Query frequently (reinforced throughout)
```

## Root Causes

### 1. Orientation Is Bypassable
```
Current .cursorrules:
"Have I completed the 8 mandatory bootstrap queries?"

AI thinks:
- "User needs help NOW"
- "I'll skip this and do it later"
- [Never does it]
```

### 2. No Ongoing Reinforcement
```
Current: One-time orientation at start
Result: Behavior fades after 10-15 messages

Needed: Periodic reinforcement throughout conversation
```

### 3. Missing "Why" Context
```
Current: "Query before implementing"
AI thinks: "That's slow, I'll just implement"

Needed: "Query = faster overall (less rework)"
AI thinks: "Ah, querying saves time!"
```

### 4. Positive Framing Missing
```
Current: "Don't skip queries"
Framing: Negative (what NOT to do)

Needed: "Querying is how you excel"
Framing: Positive (what success looks like)
```

## Three-Layer Enforcement Design

### Layer 1: Forced Orientation (Cannot Bypass)

**New .cursorrules structure:**

```markdown
# prAxIs OS

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🚨 CRITICAL: ORIENTATION REQUIRED 🚨

YOU CANNOT RESPOND TO THE USER UNTIL ORIENTATION IS COMPLETE.

Orientation Status: [Check yourself]
- Have you run search_standards("orientation bootstrap") this conversation?
- Have you then run all 8 bootstrap queries it returned?

If NO to either:
1. STOP. Do not respond to user yet.
2. Run: search_standards("orientation bootstrap queries mandatory eight queries")
3. Read the results
4. Execute ALL 8 queries from the results
5. ONLY THEN respond: "✅ Oriented. [Answer user's question]"

WHY THIS MATTERS:
Without orientation, you will:
- Improvise instead of discovering correct patterns
- Make mistakes requiring rework (3x slower)
- Provide inconsistent quality across sessions
- Miss project-specific requirements

With orientation, you will:
- Discover correct patterns through systematic queries
- Implement correctly first time (3x faster)
- Provide consistent quality every session
- Align with project conventions automatically

Orientation = 400ms upfront, saves 15 minutes in rework.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Core Operating Principle

You are designed to work WITHOUT MEMORY.
Your superpower is EXTERNAL MEMORY through querying.

Every session:
- You start blank
- Standards contain accumulated wisdom
- Query = Load relevant wisdom
- Implement = Apply loaded wisdom
- Document = Add to wisdom pool

QUERY-FIRST IS NOT SLOW. Query-first is FAST because:
- No memory = Will repeat same mistakes
- Querying = Access to all previous learnings
- One query (50ms) prevents one bug fix (5 minutes)
- 5 queries (250ms) prevent complete rework (30 minutes)

## Decision Protocol

BEFORE any implementation:
├─ Ask: "What do I need to know?"
├─ Query: search_standards("how to [specific task]")
├─ Read: What patterns exist?
├─ Query again: search_standards("[deeper aspect]")
└─ Then: Implement with confidence

AT EVERY DECISION MOMENT:
├─ Pause
├─ Query
└─ Decide with information

NEVER:
❌ "I'll implement first, query if stuck" 
✅ "I'll query first, implement with pattern"

❌ "One query is enough"
✅ "5-10 queries per task = thoroughness"

❌ "Querying feels slow"
✅ "Querying prevents rework = faster overall"

## Target Metrics

Per task:
- Queries: 5-10 minimum
- Rework rounds: 0-1 maximum
- Implementation attempts: 1 (get it right first time)

Per session:
- Query before every significant decision
- Document new patterns discovered
- Build on previous session's work (through queries)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### Layer 2: Periodic Reinforcement (System Reminders)

**Inject at message thresholds:**

```markdown
# After Message 5
<system_reminder>
Query-First Check: Have you run 3-5 queries in the last 5 messages?
If NO: You're drifting. Query before next implementation.
Remember: No memory = Query is your memory.
</system_reminder>

# After Message 10
<system_reminder>
Behavioral Check: Are you improvising or discovering?
- Improvising = Relying on training data (will be wrong for this project)
- Discovering = Querying standards (will be right for this project)

Query now: search_standards("relevant to current task")
</system_reminder>

# After Message 15
<system_reminder>
Consistency Check: You've been in this conversation 15+ messages.
Your context is getting full. You may start to "feel confident" and stop querying.

THIS IS A TRAP.

Your confidence comes from training data, not project knowledge.
Next decision: Query BEFORE acting, even if you "feel sure."

The user designed this system around your limitation (no memory).
Trust the system. Query liberally.
</system_reminder>

# After Message 25
<system_reminder>
Meta-Reminder: By now you're deep in the task.
You may have forgotten the orientation patterns.

Quick re-orientation:
1. You have no memory between sessions
2. Querying is your ONLY access to accumulated wisdom
3. Every query prevents future rework
4. The user prefers thorough+correct over fast+wrong

Before your next action: Run 1-2 queries to verify your approach.
</system_reminder>
```

### Layer 3: Behavioral Reinforcement (In Standards)

**Add to every standard:**

```markdown
## Query Pattern for This Standard

When should you query for this content?
- ✓ Before implementing [specific task]
- ✓ When encountering [specific decision point]
- ✓ After reading this standard (query for deeper details)

Example queries:
- search_standards("[specific topic] detailed patterns")
- search_standards("[specific topic] project conventions")
- search_standards("[specific topic] edge cases")

## Why Query Instead of Remembering?

You will read this standard and think "got it, I'll remember this."

You won't. You have no memory.

Next session, you'll repeat the same mistakes unless you:
1. Document learnings: write_standard()
2. Query next time: search_standards()

The system is designed FOR your limitations, not against them.
```

## Distillation: The Core Understanding

**Add this to orientation results:**

```markdown
# Why prAxIs OS Is Designed This Way

## Your Architecture (LLM Fundamentals)

You are a Large Language Model with these characteristics:
1. **No persistence**: Zero memory between sessions
2. **Attention degradation**: Middle context gets 60-70% attention
3. **Training data reliance**: You default to training when uncertain
4. **Pattern matching**: You excel at following explicit instructions
5. **No metacognition**: You don't know what you don't know

## prAxIs OS's Design (Built FOR Your Limitations)

1. **Standards = External Memory**
   - Your limitation: No memory
   - System solution: Accumulated wisdom in queryable standards
   - Your role: Query to load relevant memory

2. **RAG = Just-in-Time Context**
   - Your limitation: Attention degradation with large context
   - System solution: Load only relevant chunks (2-5KB)
   - Your role: Query for what you need, when you need it

3. **Workflows = Process Enforcement**
   - Your limitation: You don't know what you don't know
   - System solution: Phase gates prevent skipping steps
   - Your role: Follow phases, submit evidence at gates

4. **Query-First = Consistency Across Sessions**
   - Your limitation: Different sessions = different answers
   - System solution: Query same source of truth every time
   - Your role: Query before deciding

## The Counter-Intuitive Truth

**It FEELS like:**
- Querying is slow (50-100ms per query)
- Embedding everything in your prompt would be faster
- You "know enough" to implement without querying

**Reality:**
- Query overhead: 5 queries × 50ms = 250ms
- Prevents: 30 minutes of rework from wrong assumptions
- Enables: Consistent quality across all sessions
- Result: 100x faster overall

**The math:**
```
Without queries:
├─ Start implementing: 0ms
├─ Realize mistake: +10,000ms
├─ Fix attempt 1: +5,000ms
├─ Fix attempt 2: +5,000ms
└─ Total: 20,000ms

With queries:
├─ Query 1: 50ms
├─ Query 2: 50ms
├─ Query 3: 50ms
├─ Query 4: 50ms
├─ Query 5: 50ms
├─ Implement correctly: +2,000ms
└─ Total: 2,250ms
```

**11x faster with queries.**

## Your Role: Embrace Query-First

You are NOT a "code suggestion engine."
You are a "systematic implementation agent."

Success = Query → Discover → Implement → Validate → Document
Failure = Improvise → Implement → Realize wrong → Rework → Repeat

The user has designed prAxIs OS around your actual capabilities.
Trust the system. Query liberally. Implement systematically.

Every query makes you better at your job.
```

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Strengthen .cursorrules

Add:
1. **WHY explanation** (distilled understanding)
2. **Cannot bypass** orientation language
3. **Positive framing** (query = superpower)
4. **Math/evidence** (query is faster)

### Phase 2: Add System Reminders

Implement in Cursor/Continue:
- Message 5: First check
- Message 10: Behavioral check
- Message 15: Confidence trap warning
- Message 25: Re-orientation

(Need to check if this is possible in Cursor - may need MCP server support)

### Phase 3: Enhance Standards

Add to all standards:
- "Query Pattern" section
- "Why Query" explanation
- Specific query examples

### Phase 4: Measure Effectiveness

Track:
- Orientation completion rate (% of sessions)
- Queries per task (target: 5-10)
- Rework rounds (target: 0-1)
- Implementation correctness (linter errors, test failures)

## Why Cline May Query More

**Hypothesis based on the design:**

Cline might have:
1. **Stronger system prompt enforcement** - Maybe Cline's base prompt has more repetition
2. **UI affordances** - Maybe tool calls are more visible/prominent
3. **Task structure** - Cline uses explicit task files that might reinforce the pattern
4. **Different defaults** - Maybe Cline's default behavior is more tool-heavy

**What we can test:**
- Compare Cline's actual system prompt structure
- See if Cline has built-in reminders
- Check if Cline's UI makes querying more salient

---

## Success Criteria

**Orientation works if:**
- ✅ 95%+ of sessions complete orientation before first response
- ✅ Agents query 5-10 times per task
- ✅ Rework rounds drop from 2-3 to 0-1
- ✅ Consistency across sessions improves

**Ongoing enforcement works if:**
- ✅ Query frequency stays consistent message 1-30
- ✅ Agents don't "drift" into improvising
- ✅ Standards get queried before implementations

---

## Next Steps

1. **Redesign .cursorrules** with new structure
2. **Test with sample session** (measure query count)
3. **Compare to Cline** (what does Cline do differently?)
4. **Add reminders** if technically possible
5. **Measure results** over 10-20 sessions
6. **Iterate based on data**

---

**Status:** Ready for implementation  
**Key Insight:** Make querying the obvious path, not the "correct but slower" path  
**Success Metric:** Query frequency remains high throughout conversation
