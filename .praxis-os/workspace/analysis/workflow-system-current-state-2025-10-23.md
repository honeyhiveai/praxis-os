# Workflow System Deep Dive - Current State Analysis
**Date**: 2025-10-23  
**Scope**: Full architecture review following discovery phase  
**Context**: After discovering completion logic bug, expanding to comprehensive system review

---

## Executive Summary

The workflow system is a **sophisticated, production-ready phase-gating engine** with strong foundations but significant gaps in state management, validation integration, and AI resumption support. It successfully implements:

✅ **Working Well:**
- Thread-safe session management (double-checked locking)
- Dynamic workflow content (template rendering, AST parsing)
- Modular architecture (WorkflowEngine → WorkflowSession → DynamicContentRegistry)
- Comprehensive validation system (YAML gates, multi-layer validation)
- Evidence-based checkpoints (FieldSchema, CrossFieldRule, ValidatorExecutor)

❌ **Gaps Discovered:**
- Session state lacks explicit lifecycle flags (completed, paused, failed)
- No phase timing data (started_at, completed_at, duration)
- Validation system bypassed (session.py:504 `checkpoint_passed = True`)
- Missing resumption context (AI must recalculate progress on restart)
- Completion detection bug (0-indexed vs 1-indexed phase confusion)
- No `total_phases` stored in session metadata (requires cache lookup)

### 1.2 Data Flow

**Workflow Start:**
```
pos_workflow(action="start") 
  → WorkflowEngine.start_workflow()
    → load_workflow_metadata(workflow_type) → metadata.json
    → StateManager.create_session()
      → WorkflowState(current_phase=0, metadata={total_phases: 6})
      → save_state() → .cache/state/{session_id}.json
    → WorkflowSession.__init__()
      → _initialize_dynamic_registry() (if dynamic_phases=true)
        → DynamicContentRegistry
          → SpecTasksParser.parse(spec_path/tasks.md)
            → DynamicPhase[] (phase_number, tasks, validation_gate)
          → Load templates (phase-template.md, task-template.md)
    → get_current_phase() → phase 0 content
```

**Task Execution:**
```
pos_workflow(action="get_task", phase=1, task_number=2)
  → WorkflowEngine.get_task()
    → get_session(session_id) → WorkflowSession
    → WorkflowSession.get_task(1, 2)
      → DynamicContentRegistry.get_task_content(1, 2)
        → render_task(phase=1, task_number=2)
          → DynamicPhase[1].tasks[1] → DynamicTask
          → Template replacement → rendered content
```

**Phase Completion:**
```
pos_workflow(action="complete_phase", phase=1, evidence={...})
  → WorkflowEngine.complete_phase()
    → get_session(session_id) → WorkflowSession
    → WorkflowSession.complete_phase(1, evidence)
      → _validate_checkpoint() [BYPASSED: checkpoint_passed = True]
      → WorkflowState.complete_phase(1, artifact, True)
        → completed_phases.append(1)
        → current_phase = 2
        → updated_at = now()
      → StateManager.save_state()
      → get_current_phase() → next phase content
```

## 2. Current State - Detailed Analysis

### 2.1 WorkflowState Model (models/workflow.py)

**Current Structure:**
```python
@dataclass
class WorkflowState:
    session_id: str
    workflow_type: str
    target_file: str
    current_phase: int                    # ⚠️ Can be out of range (6 for 0-5 phases)
    completed_phases: List[int]           # [0,1,2,3,4,5]
    phase_artifacts: Dict[int, PhaseArtifact]
    checkpoints: Dict[int, CheckpointStatus]
    created_at: datetime                  # ✅ Session start
    updated_at: datetime                  # ⚠️ Last ANY update (not phase-specific)
    metadata: Dict[str, Any]              # {total_phases: 6, spec_path: "..."}
```

**PhaseArtifact Structure:**
```python
@dataclass
class PhaseArtifact:
    phase_number: int
    evidence: Dict[str, Any]              # Evidence submitted by AI
    outputs: Dict[str, Any]               # Phase outputs (currently unused)
    commands_executed: List[CommandExecution]  # ⚠️ Never populated
    timestamp: datetime                   # ✅ Phase completion time
```

**Issues:**
1. **No Lifecycle Flags:**
   - No `completed: bool` (must calculate from `is_complete()`)
   - No `paused: bool` 
   - No `failed_phase: Optional[int]`
   - AI must run logic to determine status

2. **No Phase Timing:**
   - Only `timestamp` on PhaseArtifact (completion time)
   - No `started_at` for each phase
   - No `duration_seconds` calculated
   - Cannot estimate remaining time

3. **current_phase Sentinel Issue:**
   - For 0-5 phases, `current_phase=6` when complete
   - Phase 6 doesn't exist! Invalid state.
   - Should keep `current_phase=5` + `completed=true`

4. **commands_executed Never Populated:**
   - `PhaseArtifact.commands_executed` is always `[]`
   - `CommandExecution` dataclass defined but unused
   - Lost command audit trail

5. **metadata is Generic Dict:**
   - No schema for what goes in `metadata`
   - `total_phases` added ad-hoc (2025-10-23)
   - Inconsistent structure across sessions

### 2.2 Completion Detection Bug

**Current Code (workflow.py:243-283):**
```python
def is_complete(self) -> bool:
    total_phases = self.metadata.get("total_phases")
    
    if total_phases is None:
        # Fallback for legacy sessions
        total_phases = 8 if "test" in self.workflow_type else 6
    
    # Detect indexing from completed_phases
    if len(self.completed_phases) > 0:
        min_phase = min(self.completed_phases)
        zero_indexed = (min_phase == 0)
    else:
        zero_indexed = (self.current_phase == 0)
    
    if zero_indexed:
        return self.current_phase >= total_phases  # 0..5 → complete when current=6
    else:
        return self.current_phase > total_phases   # 1..6 → complete when current=7
```

**Problems:**
1. **Relies on Calculation:**
   - Must recalculate every call
   - No cached result
   - Vulnerable to cache flush (MCP restart)

2. **Zero-Detection is Fragile:**
   - Empty `completed_phases` relies on `current_phase==0`
   - What if session created with `current_phase=1`?
   - Legacy sessions have no `total_phases`

3. **Fallback is Hardcoded:**
   - `8 if "test" in workflow_type else 6`
   - What about `spec_execution_v1` (dynamic phases)?
   - String matching is brittle

4. **No Validation:**
   - No check if `total_phases` matches actual workflow
   - Could be corrupted by manual edit
   - No warning if mismatch

### 2.3 Validation System (BYPASSED)

**Evidence Validation Architecture (Implemented but Disabled):**

```
CheckpointLoader (config/checkpoint_loader.py)
  → 3-Tier Fallback Strategy:
    1. gate-definition.yaml (if exists)
    2. RAG parsing (if YAML missing)
    3. Permissive gate (if RAG fails)
  
  gate-definition.yaml structure:
    checkpoint:
      strict: false
      allow_override: true
    evidence_schema:
      field_name:
        type: "boolean" | "integer" | "string" | "object" | "list"
        required: true
        validator: "positive" | "non_empty" | ...
        validator_params: {}
        description: "..."
    validators:
      custom_name: "lambda x: x > 0"
    cross_field_validation:
      - rule: "lambda e: e['frs'] >= e['goals']"
        error_message: "..."
        
ValidatorExecutor (validation/validator_executor.py)
  → Safe lambda execution (restricted globals, no __import__)
  → Common validators library (positive, non_empty, contains_any, ...)
  → Pattern blacklist (security)
  
WorkflowEngine._validate_checkpoint() (workflow_engine.py:907-1066)
  → Load gate definition (CheckpointLoader)
  → Layer 1: Check required fields present
  → Layer 2: Validate field types
  → Layer 3: Run custom validators
  → Layer 4: Cross-field validation
  → Build result: {checkpoint_passed, errors, warnings, diagnostics, remediation}
```

**The Bypass (session.py:504):**
```python
def complete_phase(self, phase: int, evidence: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    # ...
    # TODO: Implement _validate_checkpoint in workflow_engine (Tasks 1.2-1.7)
    # For now, returning True to maintain backwards compatibility
    checkpoint_passed = True  # ← BYPASSED!
    
    self.state.complete_phase(
        phase=phase,
        artifact=artifact,
        checkpoint_passed=checkpoint_passed,
    )
```

**Impact:**
- **Evidence validation spec completed** (2025-10-20)
- **gate-definition.yaml files exist** (e.g., spec_execution_v1/phases/0/gate-definition.yaml)
- **Validation system fully implemented** (CheckpointLoader, ValidatorExecutor, FieldSchema, etc.)
- **But AI can pass any evidence** (`checkpoint_passed = True` always)
- **Bootstrap problem:** Validation system built using workflow system whose validation was bypassed

**Why Not Enabled:**
- Fear of breaking existing workflows?
- Testing incomplete?
- Circular dependency concern (workflow validates workflow creation)?

### 2.4 State Manager (state_manager.py)

**Responsibilities:**
- Session lifecycle (create, load, save, delete)
- File locking (exclusive for write, shared for read)
- Cleanup (sessions older than 7 days)
- Validation (sequential phases, timestamps)

**Good:**
- ✅ Thread-safe file I/O (fcntl.flock)
- ✅ Automatic cleanup (cleanup_days=7)
- ✅ State validation (validate_state, recover_corrupted_state)
- ✅ Active session detection (get_active_session)
- ✅ Statistics (get_statistics)

**Issues:**
1. **No Phase Timing Tracking:**
   - Only `created_at`, `updated_at` on WorkflowState
   - Doesn't track when each phase started/completed
   - Could add to `save_state()` but currently doesn't

2. **Generic metadata Dict:**
   - No schema enforcement for `metadata`
   - `total_phases` added ad-hoc (recent fix)
   - Could be inconsistent across sessions

3. **No Lifecycle State:**
   - Doesn't set `completed`, `paused`, `failed_phase`
   - Relies on `is_complete()` calculation

4. **No Resumption Context:**
   - Loads raw state only
   - AI must recalculate progress, next actions
   - Could compute and cache on load

### 2.5 WorkflowSession (core/session.py)

**Purpose:**
- Session-scoped workflow execution
- Encapsulates session-specific logic
- Routes between dynamic vs static content

**Good:**
- ✅ Clean API (no session_id pollution)
- ✅ Dynamic registry initialization
- ✅ Phase gating enforcement (can_access_phase)
- ✅ Static task loading from metadata.json
- ✅ Cleanup on completion

**Issues:**
1. **Validation Bypass Here:**
   - `complete_phase()` hardcodes `checkpoint_passed = True`
   - Comment says "TODO: Implement _validate_checkpoint"
   - But `_validate_checkpoint()` exists in WorkflowEngine!
   - Just need to call it

2. **No Phase Timing:**
   - Doesn't record when phase started
   - Doesn't calculate duration
   - Could add to `complete_phase()`

3. **Limited Error Context:**
   - Raises `WorkflowSessionError` but limited context
   - No structured error tracking

### 2.6 WorkflowEngine (workflow_engine.py)

**Key Features:**
- Session cache (thread-safe, metrics tracked)
- Metadata loading (workflows_base_path/*/metadata.json)
- Phase gating enforcement
- RAG content retrieval (for static workflows)
- Validation orchestration (BYPASSED)

**Good:**
- ✅ Double-checked locking for session cache
- ✅ Metrics tracking (hits, misses, double loads)
- ✅ No metadata caching (immediate reflection of changes)
- ✅ Comprehensive validation system (`_validate_checkpoint`)
- ✅ Fallback metadata generation

**Issues:**
1. **Validation Not Called:**
   - `_validate_checkpoint()` fully implemented (lines 907-1066)
   - Multi-layer validation (fields, types, validators, cross-field)
   - Diagnostic output (errors, warnings, remediation, next_steps)
   - But WorkflowSession doesn't call it!

2. **No total_phases in Session Creation:**
   - Fixed recently (line 714-715)
   - But many existing sessions don't have it
   - Legacy fallback needed

3. **No Phase Timing:**
   - Doesn't track when phases start/complete
   - Could add to `complete_phase()`

4. **Session Cache Never Cleared:**
   - Only `clear_session_cache()` for testing
   - MCP restart flushes cache → sessions recreated
   - No warning if session corrupted

### 2.7 Session State Files (.cache/state/*.json)

**Example Session (062f24e7-6fdc-40b3-a2d8-7ffaea6351b6.json):**

```json
{
  "session_id": "062f24e7-6fdc-40b3-a2d8-7ffaea6351b6",
  "workflow_type": "spec_execution_v1",
  "target_file": ".praxis-os/specs/review/2025-10-22-aos-workflow-tool",
  "current_phase": 6,
  "completed_phases": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
  "phase_artifacts": {
    "0": { "phase_number": 0, "evidence": {...}, "timestamp": "2025-10-23T07:41:32.877071" },
    "5": { "phase_number": 5, "evidence": {...}, "timestamp": "2025-10-23T11:14:38.685799" }
  },
  "checkpoints": { "0": "passed", "5": "passed" },
  "created_at": "2025-10-23T07:40:50.690543",
  "updated_at": "2025-10-23T11:14:38.685903",
  "metadata": { "spec_path": "...", "total_phases": 6 }
}
```

**Good:**
- ✅ Rich evidence in `phase_artifacts` (detailed validation gate data)
- ✅ Clear phase progression (0→1→2→3→4→5→complete)
- ✅ Checkpoint status tracked ("passed")
- ✅ Recently fixed: `total_phases` in metadata

**Issues:**
1. **No Lifecycle Flags:**
   - Must calculate `completed` from `current_phase >= total_phases`
   - No `paused`, `failed_phase`

2. **No Phase Timing:**
   - Only `timestamp` in PhaseArtifact (completion time)
   - No `started_at`, `duration_seconds`
   - Cannot calculate: "3.5 hours elapsed, 1.5 hours remaining"

3. **commands_executed Always Empty:**
   - PhaseArtifact has `"commands_executed": []`
   - CommandExecution dataclass unused
   - Lost command audit trail

4. **current_phase=6 for 0-5 Workflow:**
   - Phases 0-5 exist, `current_phase=6` is out of range
   - Should be `current_phase=5` + `completed=true`

## 3. Goals vs Reality

### 3.1 Stated Goals (from docs)

**From `docs/explanation/how-it-works.md`:**
> "The workflow system provides phase-gating, checkpoint validation, and state persistence to guide AI through complex multi-step tasks systematically."

**From `docs/explanation/architecture.md`:**
> "Workflow Engine enforces phase gating (can only access current phase), validates evidence at checkpoints, and persists session state for resumability."

**From `docs/explanation/adversarial-design.md`:**
> "We assume AI will take shortcuts. Proof-based validation, information asymmetry, and multi-layer lie detection make compliance structurally easier than gaming."

### 3.2 Reality Check

| Goal | Implementation | Gap | Impact |
|------|----------------|-----|--------|
| **Phase Gating** | ✅ Enforced in `can_access_phase()` | None | Working correctly |
| **Checkpoint Validation** | ⚠️ Implemented but bypassed | Validation never runs | AI can pass invalid evidence |
| **State Persistence** | ✅ JSON files, file locking | No phase timing, no lifecycle flags | Limited resumption context |
| **Resumability** | ⚠️ State loads, but... | No resumption context | AI must recalculate everything |
| **Proof-Based Validation** | ✅ Evidence required | But validation bypassed | Proof not checked! |
| **Multi-Layer Validation** | ✅ Implemented (4 layers) | But validation bypassed | Layers not used |
| **Adversarial Design** | ⚠️ Validation designed for it | But validation bypassed | Trust, don't verify |

**Key Insight:** The validation system is beautifully designed (FieldSchema, ValidatorExecutor, multi-layer, config-driven, lambda validators) but completely bypassed in production. This is like building a fortress and leaving the gates open.

### 3.3 AI Experience (Main Consumer)

**What AI Receives on Session Load:**
```json
{
  "session_id": "...",
  "current_phase": 6,
  "completed_phases": [0,1,2,3,4,5],
  "is_complete": true,
  "checkpoints": {"0": "passed", ...}
}
```

**What AI Must Calculate:**
- Is workflow complete? (`is_complete()` logic)
- What phase am I on? (current_phase, but could be out of range)
- How long have I been working? (created_at to now)
- How long did each phase take? (can't - no phase timing)
- What's next? (must infer from current_phase)
- What evidence did I submit? (must read full phase_artifacts)

**What AI Wants:**
```json
{
  "session_id": "...",
  "status": "completed",  // ← explicit
  "progress": {
    "current_phase": 5,  // ← last valid phase (not 6)
    "completed_phases": [0,1,2,3,4,5],
    "total_phases": 6,
    "percent_complete": 100,
    "phases_remaining": 0
  },
  "timing": {
    "started_at": "2025-10-23T07:40:50Z",
    "last_activity": "2025-10-23T11:14:38Z",
    "total_duration_seconds": 13428,
    "average_phase_duration_seconds": 2238,
    "estimated_remaining_seconds": 0,
    "phase_timings": [
      {"phase": 0, "started_at": "...", "completed_at": "...", "duration_seconds": 42},
      {"phase": 5, "started_at": "...", "completed_at": "...", "duration_seconds": 3164}
    ]
  },
  "next_actions": [
    "Workflow complete - no further actions"
  ],
  "discovery_suggestions": [
    "Review implementation: search_standards('workflow completion best practices')",
    "Check for follow-up specs: list_dir('.praxis-os/specs/review')"
  ]
}
```

**Gap:** AI gets raw state, not actionable context. High cognitive load to reconstruct workflow status.

## 4. Areas for Improvement

### 4.1 Critical (Blocking Issues)

1. **Enable Validation System**
   - **Impact:** Currently AI can pass any evidence, defeating purpose of checkpoints
   - **Fix:** Uncomment line in `session.py:504`, call `WorkflowEngine._validate_checkpoint()`
   - **Risk:** Could break existing workflows if evidence is invalid
   - **Mitigation:** Start with `strict: false` mode (errors → warnings)
   - **Effort:** 1 line change + testing

2. **Fix Completion Detection**
   - **Impact:** `current_phase` can be out of range (6 for 0-5 phases)
   - **Fix:** Add explicit `lifecycle.completed` flag, keep `current_phase` at last valid phase
   - **Risk:** Low - more robust than calculation
   - **Effort:** Session state redesign

3. **Add total_phases to Session Creation**
   - **Impact:** Already fixed (2025-10-23), but legacy sessions lack it
   - **Fix:** Migration script to add `total_phases` to existing sessions
   - **Risk:** Low - additive change
   - **Effort:** 1 hour (script + testing)

### 4.2 High Priority (Resumption & Context)

4. **Add Phase Timing Tracking**
   - **Impact:** Cannot estimate progress, no phase performance data
   - **Fix:** Track `started_at`, `completed_at` in PhaseArtifact, calculate durations
   - **Risk:** Low - additive change
   - **Effort:** Session state redesign

5. **Add Lifecycle Flags**
   - **Impact:** AI must recalculate status (completed, paused, failed)
   - **Fix:** Add `lifecycle: {completed, paused, failed_phase}` to WorkflowState
   - **Risk:** Low - removes calculation
   - **Effort:** Session state redesign

6. **Add AI Resumption Context**
   - **Impact:** AI has high cognitive load on session load
   - **Fix:** Compute rich context on `load_state()`: progress, timing, next actions, suggestions
   - **Risk:** Low - cached context
   - **Effort:** Session state redesign + context builder

### 4.3 Medium Priority (Robustness)

7. **Validate Session Integrity on Load**
   - **Impact:** Corrupted sessions load successfully, cause runtime errors
   - **Fix:** Run `validate_state()` on every `load_state()`, warn if issues
   - **Risk:** Low - early detection
   - **Effort:** Add validation hook to StateManager

8. **Track Commands Executed**
   - **Impact:** `CommandExecution` dataclass unused, lost audit trail
   - **Fix:** Populate `commands_executed` in PhaseArtifact when AI runs commands
   - **Risk:** Low - currently unused
   - **Effort:** Integrate with MCP command tracking

9. **Add Workflow Version to Session**
   - **Impact:** No tracking of which workflow version created session
   - **Fix:** Store `workflow_version` from metadata.json in session metadata
   - **Risk:** Low - additive
   - **Effort:** 1 line in session creation

10. **Cache Workflow Metadata**
    - **Impact:** Load metadata.json on every access (currently not cached for dogfooding)
    - **Fix:** Cache with invalidation on file change
    - **Risk:** Low - performance gain
    - **Effort:** Add caching layer with mtime check

### 4.4 Low Priority (Nice to Have)

11. **Structured Error Tracking**
    - **Impact:** Errors lost in logs, no structured tracking
    - **Fix:** Add `errors: List[ErrorRecord]` to WorkflowState
    - **Risk:** Low - debugging aid
    - **Effort:** Error tracking infrastructure

12. **Pause/Resume Support**
    - **Impact:** No way to pause workflow midstream
    - **Fix:** Add `pause()`, `resume()` actions to pos_workflow
    - **Risk:** Low - workflow system supports it
    - **Effort:** Implement pause/resume handlers

13. **Rollback Support**
    - **Impact:** No way to undo phase completion
    - **Fix:** Add `rollback(to_phase)` action
    - **Risk:** Medium - state reversal complexity
    - **Effort:** Implement rollback logic

14. **Performance Monitoring**
    - **Impact:** No metrics on workflow execution
    - **Fix:** Add Prometheus metrics (phase duration, completion rate, failure rate)
    - **Risk:** Low - monitoring only
    - **Effort:** Metrics instrumentation

## 5. The Bootstrap Problem

### 5.1 Discovery

**Context:**
- Evidence validation system implemented via `spec_execution_v1` workflow
- Spec: `.praxis-os/specs/completed/2025-10-20-evidence-validation-system/`
- Workflow used to create validation system had validation BYPASSED
- Therefore: **Validation system validated itself while its own validation was off**

**Implications:**
- Can we trust the validation system?
- Was evidence for validation spec's phases actually valid?
- How do we validate validators?

### 5.2 Self-Validation Mechanisms

**What Exists:**
- ✅ Unit tests (tests/validation/, tests/config/)
- ✅ Integration tests (tests/integration/)
- ✅ gate-definition.yaml files (spec_execution_v1/phases/*/gate-definition.yaml)
- ✅ Manual code review (human in the loop)

**What's Missing:**
- ❌ External validation (independent test suite outside workflow system)
- ❌ Validation dogfooding (run validation on validation spec retroactively)
- ❌ Trust metrics (how often does validation catch issues?)
- ❌ Validation audit trail (when was validation enabled? what changed?)

### 5.3 Gradual Trust Building

**Proposed Approach:**

**Phase 1: Enable with Monitoring (Week 1)**
- Enable validation in `strict: false` mode (errors → warnings)
- Log all validation results (passed, warnings, errors)
- Monitor: Do warnings correlate with actual issues later?

**Phase 2: Retroactive Validation (Week 2)**
- Re-validate evidence from completed workflows
- Compare: Would validation have caught issues?
- Measure: False positive rate, false negative rate

**Phase 3: Strict Mode (Week 3+)**
- Enable `strict: true` for new workflows
- Require all validation errors fixed before phase completion
- Keep `strict: false` for legacy workflows

**Phase 4: Self-Validation (Ongoing)**
- Run validation spec through validator (dogfooding)
- Compare: Does current validator match spec?
- Alert: If validator behavior diverges from spec

## 6. Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate (This Week)

1. **✅ Complete this deep dive** (DONE)
   - Document current state, goals, gaps
   - Identify critical issues

2. **Create Session State Redesign Spec**
   - Design AI-optimized session structure
   - Include: lifecycle flags, phase timing, resumption context
   - Incorporate adversarial design principles
   - Account for bootstrap problem

3. **Enable Validation (strict: false)**
   - Uncomment session.py:504
   - Change to warnings mode
   - Monitor for 1 week

### Short Term (Next 2 Weeks)

4. **Implement Session State V2**
   - Follow spec from step 2
   - Migration script for legacy sessions
   - Comprehensive testing

5. **Retroactive Validation Analysis**
   - Re-run validation on completed workflows
   - Analyze false positives/negatives
   - Tune validation rules

6. **Add Phase Timing Infrastructure**
   - Track started_at, completed_at
   - Calculate durations
   - Estimate remaining time

### Medium Term (Next Month)

7. **Enable Strict Validation**
   - After monitoring period
   - Only for new workflows
   - Keep lenient for legacy

8. **AI Resumption Context**
   - Compute rich context on session load
   - Reduce AI cognitive load
   - Improve workflow efficiency

9. **Validation Dogfooding**
   - Run validation spec through validator
   - Compare implementation to spec
   - Build trust in validation system

## 7. Conclusion

The workflow system is **architecturally sound** with strong foundations:
- Thread-safe session management
- Dynamic content rendering
- Modular design
- Comprehensive validation system

But it has **critical gaps** that prevent it from achieving its goals:
- **Validation bypassed** - defeats purpose of checkpoints
- **Limited session state** - no lifecycle flags, no phase timing
- **Poor AI resumption** - high cognitive load to reconstruct status
- **Bootstrap problem** - validation system not self-validated

**The good news:** Most issues are additive changes (low risk). The validation system is fully implemented, just needs enabling. Session state redesign is the biggest effort but high value.

**Priority order:**
1. Enable validation (1 line change, but need monitoring)
2. Session state redesign (comprehensive fix, touches everything)
3. Add resumption context (AI experience improvement)
4. Self-validation (trust building, ongoing)

The workflow system can become the robust, trustworthy phase-gating engine it was designed to be - it just needs these final pieces to be production-ready in the adversarial AI environment it was built for.

**Next Action:** Create Session State Redesign design doc incorporating these findings.
