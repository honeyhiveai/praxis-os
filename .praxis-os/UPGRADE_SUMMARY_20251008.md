## Critical Safety Fix

During this upgrade, we discovered and fixed a **critical data loss vulnerability**:

**Issue:** The workflow was using `rsync --delete` on user-writable directories, which could silently delete user-created files.

**Fix:** Updated `praxis_os_upgrade_v1/phases/2/task-2-actual-upgrade.md` with:
- Clear directory classification (system-managed vs user-writable)
- Removal of `--delete` from `.praxis-os/usage/` operations
- Documentation of why each operation is safe/unsafe

**Impact:** Prevented potential data loss for all future upgrades.

## Rollback Procedure

If issues occur, rollback with:

```bash
# Stop MCP server first (restart Cursor)
rm -rf .praxis-os
mv .praxis-os.backup.20251008_193031 .praxis-os
# Restart Cursor to reload MCP server
```

---

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Restart Cursor to reload MCP server (recommended)
2. ✅ Test MCP tools with `search_standards` query
3. ✅ Verify workflows with `start_workflow`
4. After 7 days of stable operation, delete backup:
   ```bash
   rm -rf .praxis-os.backup.20251008_193031
   ```
