Integration tests for dual-transport mode.

Tests the MCP server running with both stdio and HTTP transports simultaneously.
Uses real subprocess execution and network requests to validate functionality.

NOTE: HTTP endpoint tests require proper MCP protocol implementation including
session management. For comprehensive HTTP testing, use the MCP Python SDK client.
Basic functionality is validated by test_dual_transport_simple.py.

## Overview

This is a comprehensive test standard document designed to generate meaningful
chunks for the RAG index during integration testing. It needs to have sufficient
content to be chunked properly by the indexing system.

## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to provide test data that will:
- Generate multiple text chunks for embedding
- Allow the RAG index to be built successfully
- Enable integration tests to run without errors

## Implementation Guidelines

When implementing features, follow these best practices:

1. Write clear and concise code
2. Include comprehensive documentation
3. Add unit tests for all new functionality  
4. Ensure backward compatibility
5. Follow the project's coding standards

### Code Quality

Code quality is paramount. All code should be:
- Well-documented with docstrings
- Type-annotated for clarity
- Tested with high coverage
- Reviewed by peers before merging

### Testing Standards

Tests should cover:
- Happy path scenarios
- Edge cases and boundary conditions
- Error handling and recovery
- Performance under load

## Conclusion

This test document provides sufficient content for chunk generation and RAG
index building in integration test scenarios.

## Overview
This standard is for testing the cleanup behavior of the MCP server when it shuts down.

## Requirements
- Server must clean up state files on graceful shutdown
- Server must not leave orphaned files

## Implementation Details
When the server receives a shutdown signal (SIGINT or SIGTERM), it must:
1. Stop accepting new connections
2. Wait for existing operations to complete
3. Clean up the state file
4. Exit gracefully

This content ensures the RAG index can be built successfully during the test.
