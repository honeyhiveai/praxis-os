# Query Standards

Quick search of Agent OS standards using semantic search (RAG).

## Usage

**Trigger phrases:**
- "Query standards: [question]"
- "Search standards for [topic]"
- "What do our standards say about [topic]?"

## Implementation

### 1. Execute Search
```
Use MCP: search_standards(
    query="[user's question]",
    n_results=5
)
```

### 2. Format Results

Present results clearly:

```
ðŸ“š Standards Results for "[query]"

1. [File Name] - [Section]
   [Relevant content excerpt]
   
2. [File Name] - [Section]
   [Relevant content excerpt]

...
```

### 3. Provide Context

- Summarize key points
- Highlight actionable guidance
- Point out related standards if relevant

### 4. Offer Follow-ups

Suggest related queries:
- "Also see: [related topic]"
- "For implementation details: query-standards '[specific aspect]'"
