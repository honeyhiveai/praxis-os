class CacheMetrics:
    """
    Thread-safe cache performance metrics collector.

    Tracks cache operations to monitor effectiveness and detect race conditions.
    All counter updates are protected by a lock to ensure accuracy under
    concurrent access.

    Metrics Tracked:
    - hits: Cache lookups that found existing entry
    - misses: Cache lookups that required new computation
    - double_loads: Race conditions prevented by double-checked locking
    - lock_waits: Times thread acquired lock (indication of contention)

    Thread Safety:
    - All methods use threading.Lock for atomic counter updates
    - Safe for concurrent access from multiple threads
    - No race conditions in metric collection itself

    Usage:
        >>> metrics = CacheMetrics()
        >>> metrics.record_hit()
        >>> metrics.record_miss()
        >>> stats = metrics.get_metrics()
