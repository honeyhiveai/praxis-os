    Manages transport mode execution and lifecycle.

    Orchestrates different transport modes for the MCP server:
    - Dual mode: stdio (main thread) + HTTP (background thread)

    - HTTP-only: Network communication only

    Provides:
    - Thread-safe transport orchestration
    - HTTP readiness checking with timeout
    - Graceful shutdown handling
