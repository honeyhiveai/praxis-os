# Commit Protocol

**Universal standard for structured review and commitment of changes**

---

## 🎯 TL;DR - Commit Protocol Quick Reference

**Keywords for search**: commit protocol, pre-commit review, commit checklist, quality gates, CHANGELOG, commit message, user approval, git commit, code review before commit

**Core Principle:** Never commit without passing ALL quality gates and getting user approval.

**MANDATORY Pre-Commit Steps:**
1. ✅ Run ALL quality gates (format, lint, type-check, tests)
2. ✅ Update CHANGELOG with changes
3. ✅ Present changes to user with summary
4. ✅ Get explicit user approval ("commit it" or similar)
5. ✅ Write clear commit message
6. ✅ Commit with proper git safety

**Quality Gates (ALL must pass):**
- Formatting: 100% compliant
- Linting: Meets project threshold
- Type checking: Zero errors
- Unit tests: 100% pass
- Integration tests: 100% pass

**Commit Message Format:**
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**When to Query This Standard:**
- Before any commit → `pos_search(content_type="standards", query="commit protocol")`
- Quality gates unclear → `pos_search(content_type="standards", query="pre-commit checklist")`
- CHANGELOG updates → `pos_search(content_type="standards", query="CHANGELOG format")`

## 📋 Overview

### What is Commit Protocol?

**Commit protocol** is the systematic process for reviewing, validating, and committing changes with appropriate documentation and user approval.

### Why It Matters

Without commit protocol, commits may:
- ❌ Lack proper review
- ❌ Miss CHANGELOG updates
- ❌ Have unclear boundaries (what belongs together?)
- ❌ Skip quality validation
- ❌ Lack proper documentation

With commit protocol, commits:
- ✅ Are properly reviewed
- ✅ Have appropriate CHANGELOG entries
- ✅ Have clear, logical boundaries
- ✅ Pass all quality gates
- ✅ Are well-documented

---

## 🛑 MANDATORY: Pre-Commit Review Checkpoint

**Execute BEFORE any commit. No exceptions.**

### Step 1: Quality Gates Verification

**ALL quality gates must pass before commit.**

```bash
# Run quality gates in sequence
# STOP if any fail - fix before proceeding

[format_command]              # Code formatting (100% compliance)
[lint_command]                # Static analysis (meets project threshold)
[type_check_command]          # Type checking (zero errors if required)
[unit_test_command]           # Unit tests (100% pass)
[integration_test_command]    # Integration tests (100% pass if applicable)

# Examples by language:
#
# Python:
#   tox -e format      # Black + isort
#   tox -e lint        # Pylint + mypy  
#   tox -e unit        # pytest unit tests
#   tox -e integration # pytest integration tests
#
# JavaScript:
#   npm run format     # Prettier
#   npm run lint       # ESLint + TypeScript
#   npm test           # Jest
#   npm run test:e2e   # E2E tests
#
# Go:
#   gofmt -l . && test -z "$(gofmt -l .)"
#   golint ./... && go vet ./...
#   go test ./...
#   go test ./... -tags=integration
#
# Rust:
#   cargo fmt --check
#   cargo clippy -- -D warnings
#   cargo test
#   cargo test --features integration
```

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Formatting: 100% compliant
- [ ] Static analysis: Meets project threshold
- [ ] Type checking: Zero errors (if project requires)
- [ ] Unit tests: 100% pass
- [ ] Integration tests: 100% pass (if applicable)

---

### Step 2: Documentation Review

**Verify code is properly documented.**

```bash
# Check documentation requirements

# 1. Code documentation
[check_docstrings]     # Verify public APIs have docstrings/comments
[check_examples]       # Verify examples work

# 2. Build documentation (if project has docs)
[doc_build_command]    # Documentation builds without errors

# Examples:
# Python: cd docs && make html
# JavaScript: npm run docs
# Rust: cargo doc --no-deps
```

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Public APIs have proper documentation
- [ ] Examples are included where appropriate
- [ ] Documentation builds successfully (if applicable)
- [ ] Cross-references are valid

---

### Step 3: CHANGELOG Assessment

**Determine if changes require CHANGELOG update.**

**When CHANGELOG update is needed**:
- ✅ New features visible to users
- ✅ Bug fixes that users care about
- ✅ Breaking changes or deprecations
- ✅ Performance improvements users will notice
- ✅ Security fixes

**When CHANGELOG update is NOT needed**:
- ❌ Internal refactoring (no visible changes)
- ❌ Test additions/improvements (unless testing framework change)
- ❌ Documentation-only changes (unless major docs rewrite)
- ❌ Build/CI configuration changes

**Decision Tree**:
```
Does this change affect users?
├─ YES → Does it change behavior?
│   ├─ YES → CHANGELOG required (Added/Changed/Fixed/Removed)
│   └─ NO → CHANGELOG optional (Security/Deprecated)
└─ NO → CHANGELOG not needed
```

---

### Step 4: User Review Request

**Present changes to user for review and approval.**

Use this template:

```markdown
🛑 COMMIT REVIEW CHECKPOINT

## Changes Ready for Commit

### Files Changed
- [file1.ext] - [Brief description]
- [file2.ext] - [Brief description]
- [file3.ext] - [Brief description]

### Summary of Changes
[1-2 sentence summary of what was done]

### Quality Gates Status
✅ Formatting: Passed
✅ Static Analysis: Passed ([score/metrics])
✅ Type Checking: Passed ([zero errors/metrics])
✅ Unit Tests: Passed ([count] tests)
✅ Integration Tests: Passed ([count] tests)
✅ Documentation: Built successfully

### CHANGELOG Update
**Needed**: [Yes/No]

[If Yes]:
**Proposed Entry**:
```
### [Added/Changed/Fixed/Removed/Security/Deprecated]
- [Description of change from user perspective]
```

**Category**: [Added/Changed/Fixed/Removed/Security/Deprecated]
**User Impact**: [Brief description]

[If No]:
**Reason**: [Why CHANGELOG not needed]

### Commit Decision
Please choose:
1. ✅ Create new commit
2. 🔄 Amend existing commit
3. 📝 Request changes before commit

[If you recommend new vs amend, state recommendation with reasoning]
```

---

## 🔄 Commit Decision Matrix

**Help user decide: New commit vs Amend existing.**

### Create New Commit When:

- ✅ **Implementing a new feature or fix**
  - Example: "feat: add user authentication"
  
- ✅ **Changes are logically separate from previous commit**
  - Previous: "feat: add API endpoint"
  - Current: "docs: add API documentation"
  - Decision: New commit (different concerns)

- ✅ **Previous commit has already been pushed to remote**
  - Check: `git log origin/branch..HEAD`
  - If empty: Previous commit is pushed
  - Decision: New commit (don't rewrite published history)

- ✅ **Changes represent a distinct unit of work**
  - Example: Previous commit added feature, current commit adds tests
  - Decision: Could be either, but new commit makes history clearer

---

### Amend Existing Commit When:

- ✅ **Fixing issues in the most recent commit**
  - Example: Commit added feature but forgot error handling
  - Decision: Amend (complete the original intent)

- ✅ **Adding forgotten files to the last commit**
  - Example: Forgot to add configuration file
  - Decision: Amend (part of same logical change)

- ✅ **Improving commit message of the last commit**
  - Example: Commit message was unclear
  - Decision: Amend (better communication)

- ✅ **Last commit hasn't been pushed yet**
  - Check: `git log origin/branch..HEAD`
  - If shows commit: Not pushed yet
  - Decision: Amend is safe (no published history rewrite)

- ✅ **Fixing linting/formatting in the last commit**
  - Example: Commit passed but you found minor formatting issue
  - Decision: Amend (cleanup, not separate concern)

---

### Decision Template

Present this to user:

```markdown
🔄 COMMIT ACTION DECISION

### Recent Commit
```
[Show last commit if exists]:
git log -1 --oneline
```

### Current Changes
[List files and summary]

### Recommendation
**[New Commit / Amend Existing]**

**Reasoning**: [Why this choice is appropriate]

### Please Choose
1. 🆕 New commit: "[proposed commit message]"
2. 🔄 Amend: Include changes in the existing commit
3. 📝 Different approach: [Let me know your preference]
```

## 📝 CHANGELOG Review Protocol

**When CHANGELOG update is needed.**

### Step 1: Content Verification

**Verify CHANGELOG entry is accurate and helpful.**

```markdown
## CHANGELOG Entry Review

### Proposed Entry
```
### [Category]
- [Entry text]
```

### Verification Checklist
- [ ] **Accurate**: Does it correctly describe the change?
- [ ] **User-Focused**: Is it written from user's perspective?
- [ ] **Correct Category**: Added/Changed/Fixed/Removed/Security/Deprecated?
- [ ] **Sufficient Context**: Does it provide enough information?
- [ ] **Breaking Changes**: Are they clearly marked?
```

---

### Step 2: Dual Changelog Sync (If Applicable)

**Some projects maintain two changelog formats.**

**If your project has**:
- `CHANGELOG.md` (technical details for developers)
- `docs/changelog.rst` (user-friendly highlights for documentation)

**Update both**:
```bash
# 1. Update CHANGELOG.md with technical details
[edit] CHANGELOG.md

# 2. Update docs/changelog.rst with user highlights
[edit] docs/changelog.rst

# 3. Verify consistency
# - Same version number
# - Compatible information
# - User-friendly vs technical tone appropriate
```

**Most projects only have CHANGELOG.md - update that one.**

---

### Step 3: Category Selection

**Choose the right CHANGELOG category.**

| Category | When to Use | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Added** | New features, new capabilities | "Added user authentication with JWT tokens" |
| **Changed** | Changes to existing functionality | "Changed API response format to include timestamps" |
| **Fixed** | Bug fixes | "Fixed race condition in tracer initialization" |
| **Removed** | Removed features or functionality | "Removed deprecated config.legacy_mode option" |
| **Security** | Security fixes or improvements | "Fixed SQL injection vulnerability in query builder" |
| **Deprecated** | Features marked for future removal | "Deprecated old_method() in favor of new_method()" |

**Breaking Changes**: Add `**BREAKING**:` prefix
```markdown
### Changed
- **BREAKING**: API now requires authentication for all endpoints
```

---

### Step 4: User Decision Point

**Present CHANGELOG entry for approval.**

```markdown
📝 CHANGELOG REVIEW

### Proposed CHANGELOG Entry

**Category**: [Added/Changed/Fixed/etc.]

**Entry**:
```
- [Entry text]
```

**Will be added to**:
- CHANGELOG.md (version [X.Y.Z] section)
[If applicable]:
- docs/changelog.rst (version [X.Y.Z] section)

### Please Confirm
1. ✅ Approve and commit with CHANGELOG update
2. 📝 Modify entry: [Please provide revised text]
3. ❌ Skip CHANGELOG for this change: [Please confirm skip]
```

## 🔍 Rapid Iteration Protocol

**For pre-commit check fixes, AI may iterate rapidly without asking.**

### Allowed Rapid Fixes (No User Review Needed)

These are mechanical fixes that don't change logic:

- ✅ **Formatting corrections**
  - Running Black, Prettier, gofmt, rustfmt
  - Fixing indentation
  - Organizing imports

- ✅ **Linting fixes**
  - Removing unused imports
  - Fixing linter warnings
  - Adding missing type hints (when obvious)

- ✅ **Type annotation additions**
  - Adding type hints for mypy/TypeScript
  - Fixing type errors

- ✅ **Import organization**
  - Sorting imports
  - Removing duplicates
  - Adding missing imports

**AI may state**:
```
"Found formatting issues. Fixing automatically..."
[runs formatter]
"Formatting complete. Re-running quality gates..."
[re-runs gates]
"All quality gates now pass. Ready to commit."
```

---

### Still Requires Review (Must Ask User)

These change behavior or require decisions:

- 🛑 **CHANGELOG updates** - Always pause for user review
- 🛑 **Breaking changes** - Require explicit user approval
- 🛑 **Architecture modifications** - Need user guidance
- 🛑 **New dependencies** - Require user approval
- 🛑 **Logic changes** - Must review with user
- 🛑 **Test changes** (beyond mechanical) - Must review

---

## ✅ Commit Message Standards

**Follow project's commit message convention.**

### Conventional Commits (Common Standard)

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Types**:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only
- `style`: Formatting, missing semicolons, etc. (no code change)
- `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes bug nor adds feature
- `test`: Adding or correcting tests
- `chore`: Maintenance (dependencies, build, etc.)

**Examples**:
```
feat(auth): add JWT token authentication

Implements JWT-based authentication for API endpoints.
Includes middleware for token validation and refresh.

Closes #123
```

```
fix(tracer): resolve race condition in initialization

Adds mutex lock to prevent concurrent initialization.
Includes regression test.

Fixes #456
```

### Project-Specific Conventions

**Check project's CONTRIBUTING.md or README.md for commit conventions.**

Some projects use:
- Different type names (e.g., `feature:` instead of `feat:`)
- Issue tracker integration (e.g., "Resolves #123")
- Sign-off requirements (e.g., `Signed-off-by:`)
- DCO (Developer Certificate of Origin)

2. 📝 Modify commit message or CHANGELOG
3. 🔄 Make additional changes
```

---

### Example 2: Bug Fix (Amend Scenario)

```markdown
🛑 COMMIT REVIEW CHECKPOINT

## Recent Commit
```
feat(auth): add JWT token authentication
```
(Not yet pushed to remote)

## Current Changes

### Files Changed
- src/auth/jwt.py - Added missing error handling for expired tokens

### Summary of Changes
Added error handling for expired tokens that was missing from the authentication implementation.

### Quality Gates Status
✅ All gates pass (with fix included)

### CHANGELOG Update
**Needed**: No

**Reason**: This is completing the original feature, not a separate change. The CHANGELOG entry already covers JWT authentication.

### Commit Decision
**Recommendation**: Amend existing commit

**Reasoning**: 
- This error handling was part of the original feature intent
- The original commit hasn't been pushed yet
- This completes the feature rather than being a separate fix

Please choose:
1. 🔄 Amend existing commit (recommended)
2. 🆕 Create new commit (if you prefer separate history)
3. 📝 Different approach
```

### Example 3: Rapid Iteration (Formatting Fix)

```markdown
Running pre-commit quality gates...

❌ Formatting: Failed
  - src/auth/jwt.py: Line too long (91 > 88)
  - tests/test_auth.py: Unsorted imports

Fixing formatting issues automatically...
[runs black and isort]

Re-running quality gates...
✅ Formatting: Passed
✅ All other gates: Passed

All quality gates now pass. Ready to commit.

[Proceeds to commit review checkpoint]
```

**Note**: No user interaction needed for mechanical formatting fixes.

## 🔗 Project-Specific Commit Protocols

**Projects may extend with additional commit requirements.**

### Creating Commit Protocol Addendum

**File**: `.praxis-os/standards/development/commit-protocol-addendum.md`

**Example Contents**:

```markdown
# Project Name - Commit Protocol Addendum

## Additional Requirements

### Commit Message Format
- Use conventional commits format
- Include issue tracker reference: "Closes #123"
- Sign-off required: `git commit -s`

### Pre-Commit Checks
- Run `npm run pre-commit` before every commit
- Verify package-lock.json is updated if dependencies changed
- Check bundle size hasn't increased more than 5%

### CHANGELOG Management
- Update both CHANGELOG.md and docs/changelog.rst
- Use version from package.json
- Follow semantic versioning

### Review Requirements
- All commits must pass CI before merge
- At least one approval required for PRs
- Breaking changes require architectural review
```

---

## 📚 Commit Hygiene Best Practices

### Small, Focused Commits

✅ **Good**:
```
feat(auth): add JWT token generation
feat(auth): add JWT token validation  
feat(auth): add token refresh endpoint
test(auth): add JWT token tests
```

❌ **Bad**:
```
feat(auth): add complete authentication system
  (Contains 10 different concerns in one commit)
```

---

### Atomic Commits

**Each commit should be independently functional.**

✅ **Good**: Each commit leaves system in working state
- Commit 1: Add feature (system works)
- Commit 2: Add tests (system still works)
- Commit 3: Add docs (system still works)

❌ **Bad**: Commits depend on each other
- Commit 1: Add half of feature (system broken)
- Commit 2: Add other half (system fixed)

---

### Clear Commit Messages

✅ **Good**: Explains what and why
```
fix(auth): prevent race condition in token refresh

The token refresh logic had a race condition when multiple
requests attempted to refresh simultaneously. Added mutex
lock to serialize refresh operations.

Fixes #456
```

❌ **Bad**: Vague or useless
```
fix stuff
update code
wip
```

## 🎓 Teaching Commit Protocol to New AI Assistants

### Key Principles

1. **Quality first** - Never commit without passing all quality gates
2. **Review always** - Always present changes for user review
3. **CHANGELOG matters** - User-visible changes need documentation
4. **Atomic commits** - Each commit should be independently meaningful
5. **Rapid iteration for mechanical** - Format/lint fixes can be automatic

## ❓ FAQ

### Q: Should I commit after every file in a multi-file task?

**A**: No. Generate all related files, then commit them together as one logical unit.

### Q: What if quality gates fail?

**A**: Fix the issues. Never commit with failing quality gates. Use rapid iteration for mechanical fixes (formatting, etc.).

### Q: What if I'm not sure if CHANGELOG is needed?

**A**: Ask yourself: "Will users notice this change?" If yes, CHANGELOG is probably needed. When in doubt, ask user.

### Q: Can I skip user review for small changes?

**A**: No. Always present changes for review (except rapid iteration fixes like formatting).

### Q: What if user wants to modify the CHANGELOG entry?

**A**: Update the CHANGELOG with their revision, then proceed with commit.
