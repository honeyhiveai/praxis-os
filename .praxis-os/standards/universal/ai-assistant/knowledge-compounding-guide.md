## üéØ TL;DR - Knowledge Compounding Quick Reference

**Core Principle:** Systems improve through documented learnings. When you discover a pattern, document it for future agents.

**The Compounding Effect:**
```
Day 1: Universal standards only
Day 30: + 20 project-specific patterns (documented by agents)
Day 90: + 50 patterns, 5 custom workflows
Day 180: + 100 patterns, systematic reuse

Knowledge density increases ‚Üí Quality compounds automatically
```

**Pattern: Search ‚Üí Implement ‚Üí Document**
1. Query before implementing: `search_standards("how to [task]")`
2. Implement following patterns
3. Discover new project-specific pattern
4. Document learning: `create_standard("project/[domain]", "[pattern-name]", content)`
5. Future agents discover via RAG

**When to Document:**
- ‚úÖ Discovered a pattern worth reusing
- ‚úÖ Solved a project-specific problem
- ‚úÖ Found an integration approach
- ‚úÖ Created a domain convention
- ‚úÖ Identified an optimization

**When NOT to Document:**
- ‚ùå One-time implementation details
- ‚ùå Already covered in universal standards
- ‚ùå Project README content
- ‚ùå Temporary workarounds

---

## üéØ Purpose

This standard defines how to capture learnings as project-specific standards, enabling knowledge compounding where the system improves through accumulated documentation.

**Questions This Answers:**
- When should I document a pattern as a standard?
- How do I use create_standard to capture learnings?
- What's the difference between project and universal standards?
- How does knowledge compounding improve agent output quality?
- What makes a good project-specific standard?

## ‚ö†Ô∏è The Problem Without Knowledge Compounding

**Without documentation pattern:**

```
‚ùå Agent 1 (Week 1):
- Implements authentication
- Discovers project uses custom JWT refresh pattern
- Completes task
- Learning lost

‚ùå Agent 2 (Week 3):
- Implements authorization
- Needs same JWT refresh pattern
- Cannot find prior work
- Reinvents pattern (slightly different)
- Inconsistency in codebase

‚ùå Agent 3 (Week 5):
- Debugging auth issues
- Two different JWT patterns in code
- Confusion about which is correct
- Time wasted on investigation
```

**With documentation pattern:**

```
‚úÖ Agent 1 (Week 1):
- Implements authentication
- Discovers custom JWT refresh pattern
- Documents: create_standard("project/auth", "jwt-refresh-pattern", "...")
- Learning captured

‚úÖ Agent 2 (Week 3):
- Needs JWT pattern
- Queries: search_standards("JWT refresh pattern")
- RAG returns Agent 1's documentation
- Uses consistent pattern
- No reinvention

‚úÖ Agent 3 (Week 5):
- Working on auth
- Queries standards
- Finds documented pattern
- Follows established convention
- Codebase consistency maintained
```

**Result Without:** Knowledge loss, inconsistency, reinvention, quality degradation  
**Result With:** Knowledge growth, consistency, reuse, quality improvement

## üìã The Standard: Knowledge Compounding Pattern

### The Three-Step Pattern

**1. Query Before Implementing (Discovery)**
```
Before writing code:
search_standards("how to [implement task in domain]")

Purpose: Learn from existing patterns
Benefit: Don't reinvent, follow conventions
```

**2. Implement Following Patterns (Execution)**
```
Implement using discovered patterns
Apply project conventions
Solve project-specific challenges

During: Notice what's project-specific vs universal
```

**3. Document New Patterns (Capture)**
```
After implementing, if you discovered something reusable:
create_standard(
    "project/[domain]",
    "[pattern-name]",
    "[markdown content]"
)

Purpose: Capture learning for future agents
Benefit: System improves through use
```

### Using create_standard Tool

**Tool Signature:**
```python
create_standard(
    category: str,      # "project/[domain]" or "universal/[category]"
    name: str,          # "pattern-name" (descriptive, kebab-case)
    content: str        # Markdown content (RAG-optimized)
)
```

**Category Conventions:**

**Project-specific patterns:**
- `project/auth` - Authentication patterns
- `project/database` - Database patterns
- `project/api` - API conventions
- `project/testing` - Test patterns
- `project/[domain]` - Domain-specific

**Universal patterns** (rare - most learnings are project-specific):
- `universal/[category]` - Only if applies to ALL projects

**Naming Conventions:**
- Use kebab-case: `jwt-refresh-pattern` not `JWTRefreshPattern`
- Be descriptive: `api-error-handling` not `errors`
- Include domain context: `database-migration-pattern` not `migrations`

### Content Structure for Project Standards

**RAG-optimized structure:**

```markdown
# [Pattern Name]

**Keywords for search**: [natural language phrases agents might query]

---

## ‚úÖ Checklist: When to Document a Pattern

**Document as project standard when:**

- [ ] Pattern is project-specific (not covered in universal standards)
- [ ] Pattern will be reused (at least 2-3 more times)
- [ ] Pattern encodes project conventions or decisions
- [ ] Pattern solves a recurring problem
- [ ] Pattern represents a discovered optimization
- [ ] Pattern clarifies project-specific integration

**Don't document as standard when:**

- [ ] Already covered in universal standards (query first!)
- [ ] One-time implementation detail
- [ ] Better suited for project README
- [ ] Temporary workaround (not a pattern)
- [ ] Too implementation-specific (no reuse)

**Content quality checklist:**

- [ ] RAG-optimized (keywords, query hooks)
- [ ] Clear TL;DR at top
- [ ] Real code examples included
- [ ] When to use / not use guidance
- [ ] Related patterns linked via queries

---

## üìñ Examples

### Example 1: Documenting Auth Pattern

**Scenario:** Implementing authentication, discover project uses custom JWT refresh approach.

**‚úÖ Good Documentation:**

```python
# After implementing auth successfully:

create_standard(
    category="project/auth",
    name="jwt-refresh-token-pattern",
    content="""
# JWT Refresh Token Pattern

**Keywords for search**: JWT refresh, token refresh, authentication refresh, session renewal, refresh token rotation

---

## üéØ TL;DR

This project uses **refresh token rotation** with Redis for session management.

**Key approach:**
- Access tokens: 15min expiry
- Refresh tokens: 7 day expiry, single-use
- Storage: Redis with user:refresh:{token} keys
- On refresh: Issue new access + new refresh, revoke old refresh

---

## Context

Requirement: Long-lived sessions without compromising security.
Solution: Short access tokens + rotated refresh tokens.
Discovered: Week 1, authentication implementation.

---

## The Pattern

[Detailed implementation with code examples]
[Redis key structure]
[Refresh flow diagram]
[Error handling]

---

## Example Implementation

[Actual code from the project]

---

## When to Use This Pattern

- ‚úÖ All authentication endpoints
- ‚úÖ Session management
- ‚ùå Not for API keys (different pattern)
- ‚ùå Not for service-to-service (use different approach)
"""
)
```

**Why this is good:**
- ‚úÖ RAG-optimized with keywords
- ‚úÖ Clear TL;DR with key decisions
- ‚úÖ Context explains why
- ‚úÖ Real implementation details
- ‚úÖ Guidance on when to use

### Example 2: Documenting Database Pattern

**Scenario:** Implementing database migrations, discover project-specific rollback strategy.

**‚úÖ Good Documentation:**

```python
create_standard(
    category="project/database",
    name="migration-rollback-strategy",
    content="""
# Migration Rollback Strategy

**Keywords for search**: database migration, rollback, migration failures, database rollback, migration recovery, schema changes

---

## üéØ TL;DR

This project uses **dual-direction migrations** with automatic rollback on failure.

**Key approach:**
- Every migration has up() and down()
- Migrations run in transaction (when possible)
- On failure: Automatic rollback via down()
- State tracking in migrations_history table

---

## Context

Requirement: Safe schema changes in production.
Challenge: Some DDL operations not transactional.
Solution: Explicit rollback procedures + state tracking.

---

## The Pattern

[Implementation details]
[Transaction handling]
[Non-transactional DDL approach]
[State tracking logic]

---

## Example Implementation

[Real migration examples from project]
[Rollback examples]
[Error handling examples]
"""
)
```

### Example 3: What NOT to Document

**‚ùå Don't document this:**

```python
# After implementing a specific feature:

create_standard(
    category="project/features",
    name="user-profile-endpoint",
    content="Implementation of /api/users/:id endpoint..."
)
```

**Why not:**
- ‚ùå Implementation detail, not a pattern
- ‚ùå No reuse (specific to one endpoint)
- ‚ùå Belongs in code comments or API docs
- ‚ùå Not a learnable pattern

**‚úÖ Document this instead:**

```python
create_standard(
    category="project/api",
    name="rest-endpoint-pattern",
    content="""
# REST Endpoint Pattern

This project's convention for RESTful endpoints:
- Naming: /api/resources/:id
- Error responses: {error, message, remediation}
- Validation: Middleware approach
- Authentication: JWT header check

[Reusable across ALL endpoints]
"""
)
```

---

## üö´ Anti-Patterns

### Anti-Pattern 1: Not Documenting Discoveries

**‚ùå Don't do this:**
```
Agent: [Solves complex integration problem]
Agent: [Finishes implementation]
Agent: "Done! Moving to next task"
Learning: Lost forever
Future agents: Reinvent the same solution
```

**‚úÖ Do this instead:**
```
Agent: [Solves complex integration problem]
Agent: "This integration pattern is reusable"
Agent: create_standard("project/integrations", "api-retry-pattern", "...")
Learning: Captured and discoverable
Future agents: search_standards("API retry") ‚Üí Find and reuse
```

### Anti-Pattern 2: Documentation Dump

**‚ùå Don't do this:**
```python
create_standard(
    category="project/everything",
    name="all-our-patterns",
    content="""
    [50 pages of everything we do]
    [No structure]
    [Not RAG-optimized]
    [Not discoverable]
    """
)
```

**‚úÖ Do this instead:**
```python
# Create focused, discoverable standards:

create_standard("project/auth", "jwt-pattern", "[JWT-specific content]")
create_standard("project/auth", "session-management", "[Session content]")
create_standard("project/api", "error-responses", "[Error content]")

# Each standard: focused, discoverable, reusable
```

### Anti-Pattern 3: Documenting Universal Patterns

**‚ùå Don't do this:**
```python
create_standard(
    category="project/concurrency",
    name="race-conditions",
    content="Race conditions happen when... [general CS concept]"
)
```

**Why not:**
- ‚ùå Already in universal standards
- ‚ùå Not project-specific
- ‚ùå Creates duplication

**‚úÖ Do this instead:**
```python
# If project has SPECIFIC race condition pattern:

create_standard(
    category="project/concurrency",
    name="websocket-broadcast-locking",
    content="""
    This project's pattern for WebSocket broadcasts to avoid race conditions:
    - Use Redis pub/sub for coordination
    - Lock pattern: websocket:broadcast:{room_id}
    - [Project-specific implementation]
    """
)
```

## üìà The Compounding Effect

**Knowledge growth over time:**

```
Week 1:
- Universal standards: 100 documents
- Project standards: 0 documents
- Query quality: Good (universal patterns)

Week 4:
- Universal standards: 100 documents
- Project standards: 15 documents (agents documented learnings)
- Query quality: Excellent (universal + project-specific)
- Consistency: High (agents follow documented patterns)

Week 12:
- Universal standards: 100 documents
- Project standards: 50 documents
- Query quality: Exceptional (deep project knowledge)
- Consistency: Very high (established conventions)
- Speed: Faster (less reinvention)
- Quality: 85-95% (vs 60-70% without compounding)

Week 24:
- Universal standards: 100 documents
- Project standards: 100+ documents
- Query quality: Expert-level (comprehensive knowledge base)
- New agents: Onboard faster (query to learn)
- Team knowledge: Captured and accessible
```

**System improves through use. This is knowledge compounding.**

## üìû Questions?

**How do I know if something should be documented?**
‚Üí Ask: "Would future agents benefit from knowing this?" If yes, document it.

**What's the difference between project and universal standards?**
‚Üí Universal: Applies to ALL projects. Project: Specific to THIS project's conventions and patterns.

**Should I document every implementation?**
‚Üí No. Document patterns, not implementations. Patterns are reusable, implementations are one-time.

**What if I'm not sure if something is a pattern?**
‚Üí If you'd want to reuse it 2-3 more times in this project, it's a pattern. Document it.

**Can I update existing project standards?**
‚Üí Yes! If you discover improvements or refinements, update the standard. Knowledge evolves.

**How do I make sure my standard is discoverable?**
‚Üí Follow RAG optimization: keywords, query hooks, TL;DR, natural language headers. See: `search_standards("RAG content authoring")`
