# Creating prAxIs OS Specifications

**Universal documentation for writing design specifications in any prAxIs OS project.**

**Keywords for search**: creating specs, how to write specifications, spec structure, design documents, software requirements document, SRD, specification templates, task breakdown, implementation planning

---

## 🚨 Quick Reference (TL;DR)

**5-File Spec Structure:**
1. **README.md** - Executive summary, status, quick overview (for stakeholders)
2. **srd.md** - Business requirements, goals, success metrics (Software Requirements Document)
3. **specs.md** - Technical specifications, architecture, design decisions
4. **tasks.md** - Implementation task breakdown with phases and dependencies
5. **implementation.md** - Detailed step-by-step implementation guidance

**All specs live in:** `.praxis-os/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name/`

**Quick Start:**
1. Create spec directory: `.praxis-os/specs/2025-10-11-my-feature/`
2. Copy 5 templates from this guide
3. Fill in README.md first (executive summary)
4. Then srd.md (business requirements)
5. Then specs.md (technical design)
6. Then tasks.md (break down into phases/tasks)
7. Finally implementation.md (detailed guidance)

**When to create a spec:**
- ✅ Feature affects multiple files/components
- ✅ Architectural decisions needed
- ✅ Need to track multi-phase work
- ✅ Collaboration with team/stakeholders
- ❌ Simple bug fixes (no spec needed)
- ❌ Single-file changes (no spec needed)

## 🎯 What Is a Spec?

A **specification (spec)** is a design document that details a feature, enhancement, or architectural decision before implementation. Specs help:

- **Plan before coding** - Think through design challenges
- **Document decisions** - Record why choices were made
- **Enable collaboration** - Share context with team and AI
- **Track progress** - Break work into phases and tasks

## What is the Standard Spec Directory Structure?

All specs follow this standard structure (inspired by python-sdk prAxIs OS):

```
.praxis-os/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name/
├── README.md         # Executive summary, status, quick overview
├── srd.md           # Business requirements and goals (Software Requirements Document)
├── specs.md         # Technical specifications and design
├── tasks.md         # Implementation task breakdown
└── implementation.md # Detailed implementation guidance
```

### Optional Additional Files

```
├── testing-strategy.md   # Testing approach and requirements
├── case-study.md         # Real-world examples or case studies
├── VALIDATION.md         # Validation criteria and success metrics
└── [custom].md          # Any domain-specific documents

## How to Validate Spec Completeness (Checklist)

When creating a new spec, ensure:

### Structure
- [ ] Directory named `YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name/`
- [ ] `README.md` with executive summary
- [ ] `srd.md` with business requirements
- [ ] `specs.md` with technical design
- [ ] `tasks.md` with implementation breakdown
- [ ] `implementation.md` with detailed guidance

### Content Quality
- [ ] Clear problem statement
- [ ] Specific success metrics
- [ ] Comprehensive requirements
- [ ] Detailed technical design
- [ ] Phased implementation plan
- [ ] Testing strategy included
- [ ] Security considerations addressed
- [ ] Performance targets defined

### Completeness
- [ ] All stakeholders identified
- [ ] All acceptance criteria defined
- [ ] All dependencies documented
- [ ] All risks identified with mitigation
- [ ] All integration points specified

## How to Review Specs?

### How to Self-Review Your Spec
1. Read spec end-to-end
2. Verify all sections are complete
3. Check for consistency across files
4. Validate technical feasibility

### How to Get Peer Review
1. Share spec with team/AI
2. Address feedback
3. Update documentation
4. Get approval

### How to Track Implementation Progress
1. Break into tasks
2. Assign ownership
3. Track progress
4. Update status regularly

---

## What are Spec Writing Best Practices?

### What TO DO:
✅ Write specs before coding  
✅ Use concrete examples  
✅ Define success metrics  
✅ Include diagrams/visuals  
✅ Document trade-offs  
✅ Update specs as design evolves  
✅ Link to related specs  
✅ Keep language clear and precise

### What NOT TO DO:
❌ Skip business requirements  
❌ Assume implementation details  
❌ Ignore non-functional requirements  
❌ Forget to update during implementation  
❌ Write specs that are too abstract  
❌ Neglect security/performance  
❌ Skip validation criteria

3. **Creating Business Requirements**
   - Situation: Need template for Software Requirements Document
   - Query: `search_standards("software requirements document template")`

4. **Breaking Down Implementation**
   - Situation: Need to create tasks.md with phases
   - Query: `search_standards("how to break down implementation tasks")`

5. **Writing Technical Specs**
   - Situation: Need template for technical architecture
   - Query: `search_standards("technical specification template")`

6. **Validating Spec Completeness**
   - Situation: Want to ensure all required sections are present
   - Query: `search_standards("spec checklist requirements")`
