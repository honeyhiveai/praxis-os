# Pylint Disable Policy

**Define when and how to use pylint disable pragmas, with strong preference for fixing code over suppressing warnings.**

---

## üö® TL;DR - Pylint Disable Policy Quick Reference

**Keywords for search**: pylint disable, pylint pragma, suppress warnings, code quality, pylint exceptions, global disable, per-file disable, inline disable, pyproject.toml disable, pylint policy, when to disable pylint, how to suppress pylint warnings

**Core Principle:** Fix the code, don't suppress the warning. Pylint warnings exist to catch real quality issues.

**Current Global Disables (pyproject.toml):**
```toml
disable = [
    "too-few-public-methods",  # Dataclasses and data models
    "import-error",            # Mypy and tests catch these
]
```

**Approval Required For:**
- ‚úÖ New global disables in `pyproject.toml` (almost never acceptable)
- ‚úÖ Per-file disables with detailed justification
- ‚ùå Inline `# pylint: disable` comments (strongly discouraged)

**Decision Tree:**
1. Can you refactor the code? ‚Üí Do it
2. Is it a false positive? ‚Üí Still try to refactor first
3. Is it intentional design? ‚Üí Document with per-file disable + justification
4. Unsure? ‚Üí Ask for review before suppressing

**Quality Target:** 10.0/10 for all new code

## üéØ Purpose

Maintain code quality by minimizing pylint warning suppressions. Establish clear policy for when warnings can be suppressed and require explicit justification for all exceptions.

---

## üö® The Problem - What Happens Without This Policy

**Without policy:**
```python
# Developer hits warning, takes easy route
def complex_function(a, b, c, d, e, f, g):  # pylint: disable=too-many-arguments
    var1 = ...  # pylint: disable=invalid-name
    var2 = ...  # pylint: disable=invalid-name
    # ... suppression proliferates
```

**Result:** Code quality degrades, warnings lose meaning, technical debt accumulates

**With policy:**
```python
# Developer refactors to fix root cause
def complex_function(config: FunctionConfig):
    prepared_data = _prepare_data(config)
    return _process_data(prepared_data)
```

**Result:** Better code, maintainable quality, meaningful warnings

## üìã The Standard - Pylint Disable Rules

### Rule 1: Default Stance

**Fix the code, don't suppress the warning.**

Pylint warnings indicate real quality issues. Suppression should be rare and always justified.

### Rule 2: Global Disables (pyproject.toml)

**Only 2 global disables currently approved:**

```toml
[tool.pylint.messages_control]
disable = [
    "too-few-public-methods",  # Many dataclasses and simple classes
    "import-error",            # Handled by mypy and testing
]
```

**Adding new global disables requires:**
1. Team discussion
2. Documented decision in this file
3. Update to `pyproject.toml` with inline justification

**Rationale for current disables:**
- `too-few-public-methods`: Python dataclasses intentionally minimal
- `import-error`: False positives during development; mypy catches real issues

### Rule 3: Per-File Disables

**Allowed only with explicit, detailed justification at top of file.**

**Required format:**
```python
# pylint: disable=specific-warning-name
# Justification: Clear, specific reason why suppression is necessary
# and why the code cannot be refactored to avoid the warning.
# Must explain the trade-off and why this is the best solution.
```

**Examples of acceptable per-file disables:**

```python
# pylint: disable=too-many-lines
# Justification: WorkflowEngine is the core orchestration component with
# phase gating, checkpoints, validation, content rendering, and session 
# management (1270 lines). Splitting would fragment cohesive workflow logic.
# Alternative considered: Multiple files would break atomic workflow state.
```

```python
# pylint: disable=too-many-instance-attributes
# Justification: Data models (dataclasses) require many attributes to represent
# complete workflow state, metadata, and checkpoint information. This is by 
# design for comprehensive type-safe data structures per domain-driven design.
```

```python
# pylint: disable=broad-exception-caught
# Justification: Workflow engine must be robust - catches broad exceptions
# to provide graceful degradation and detailed error messages for AI agents.
# Specific exceptions re-raised after logging. Alternative (narrow catching)
# would miss edge cases and break workflow execution.
```

### Rule 4: Inline Disables

**STRONGLY DISCOURAGED. Almost never acceptable.**

Inline `# pylint: disable=...` comments are code smell indicators:
- Code has a quality issue
- We're hiding it instead of fixing it
- Technical debt accumulates silently

**The ONE exception - Protected access within same logical module:**

```python
# Accessing internal cache within the same module
if hasattr(wf_tools, "_workflow_metadata_cache"):
    wf_tools._workflow_metadata_cache.clear()  # pylint: disable=protected-access
```

**But even then:** Prefer refactoring to a public API.

### Rule 5: Approval Process

**Before using any per-file disable:**

1. **Try to fix the code first**
   - Refactor function into smaller pieces
   - Use better data structures
   - Simplify logic

2. **If truly unfixable**, document why
   - What refactoring was attempted?
   - Why didn't it work?
   - What's the trade-off?

3. **Get explicit approval**
   - Team discussion or PR review
   - Explain why this is best solution
   - Document decision

4. **Add detailed justification**
   - Multi-line comment explaining trade-off
   - Reference alternatives considered
   - Link to design decision if relevant

## ‚úÖ Checklist - Before Disabling Any Warning

- [ ] Have I tried to refactor the code to fix the warning?
- [ ] Have I considered all alternatives (data structures, patterns)?
- [ ] Is this truly an intentional design decision (not laziness)?
- [ ] Have I written a detailed justification (not just "needed for X")?
- [ ] Have I explained WHY code can't be refactored?
- [ ] Have I documented alternatives considered?
- [ ] Have I gotten approval from team/reviewer?
- [ ] Is this the minimum scope disable (file vs global)?
- [ ] Will this make sense to someone reading it in 6 months?

## üéì Examples - How to Fix Instead of Suppress

### Example 1: Too Many Arguments

‚ùå **WRONG: Suppress the warning**
```python
def process_data(a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h):  # pylint: disable=too-many-arguments
    pass
```

‚úÖ **CORRECT: Group related parameters**
```python
@dataclass
class ProcessConfig:
    input_data: str
    output_path: Path
    validation_rules: List[Rule]
    timeout_seconds: int

def process_data(config: ProcessConfig):
    pass
```

### Example 2: Too Many Local Variables

‚ùå **WRONG: Suppress the warning**
```python
def complex_function():  # pylint: disable=too-many-locals
    var1 = ...
    var2 = ...
    # ... 30 more variables
```

‚úÖ **CORRECT: Extract helper functions**
```python
def complex_function():
    prepared_data = _prepare_data()
    validated_data = _validate_data(prepared_data)
    return _process_data(validated_data)

def _prepare_data():
    # Variables scoped to preparation
    pass

def _validate_data(data):
    # Variables scoped to validation
    pass
```

### Example 3: Unused Variable

‚ùå **WRONG: Suppress the warning**
```python
result = expensive_function()  # pylint: disable=unused-variable
# ... result never used
```

‚úÖ **CORRECT: Remove unused code**
```python
# Don't capture if you don't need it
expensive_function()

# Or actually use it
result = expensive_function()
return result
```

### Example 4: Too Many Branches

‚ùå **WRONG: Suppress the warning**
```python
def handle_request(request_type):  # pylint: disable=too-many-branches
    if request_type == "A":
        ...
    elif request_type == "B":
        ...
    # ... 15 more branches
```

‚úÖ **CORRECT: Use dispatch pattern**
```python
REQUEST_HANDLERS = {
    "A": handle_type_a,
    "B": handle_type_b,
    # ... handlers as functions
}

def handle_request(request_type):
    handler = REQUEST_HANDLERS.get(request_type, handle_unknown)
    return handler()
```

## ‚ùå Anti-Patterns - Common Mistakes

### Anti-Pattern 1: Suppressing Instead of Understanding

```python
# ‚ùå BAD: Suppress warning without understanding
result = func()  # pylint: disable=unused-variable

# ‚úÖ GOOD: Understand why warning exists, fix root cause
# If result truly not needed:
func()  # Just call without capturing
```

### Anti-Pattern 2: Vague Justification

```python
# ‚ùå BAD: No real justification
# pylint: disable=too-many-arguments
# Justification: Needed for functionality

# ‚úÖ GOOD: Detailed trade-off explanation
# pylint: disable=too-many-arguments  
# Justification: MCP tool registration requires 8 parameters to wire all
# tool groups (RAG, workflow, browser, generators, validators) with optional
# dependencies. Grouping into config object considered but rejected because:
# 1. Parameters have different lifecycles (some created early, some late)
# 2. Would require passing entire config through 5 layers (coupling)
# 3. MCP server interface expects flat parameters per FastMCP spec
```

### Anti-Pattern 3: Inline Disables Everywhere

```python
# ‚ùå BAD: Suppress at every occurrence
var1 = data  # pylint: disable=invalid-name
var2 = more  # pylint: disable=invalid-name
var3 = stuff  # pylint: disable=invalid-name

# ‚úÖ GOOD: Fix the naming
input_data = data
processed_data = more
output_data = stuff
```

### Anti-Pattern 4: Global Disable for Convenience

```toml
# ‚ùå BAD: Disable globally because "it's annoying"
disable = [
    "too-many-arguments",
    "too-many-locals", 
    "too-many-branches"
]

# ‚úÖ GOOD: Keep strict standards, refactor when needed
disable = [
    "too-few-public-methods",  # Dataclasses intentionally minimal
    "import-error",            # Mypy catches these
]
```
