MANDATORY ORIENTATION - MUST COMPLETE BEFORE RESPONDING:

Have I completed the 10 mandatory bootstrap queries this conversation?

If NO, run this query NOW:
    search_standards("orientation bootstrap queries mandatory ten queries")

Then READ the results. The results will contain 10 queries you MUST run.
Execute ALL 10 queries IN SEQUENCE.
AFTER all 10 complete, reply: "✅ Oriented. Ready."

If YES (already completed 10/10): Proceed with user's request.

🔍 EVERY USER REQUEST = DECISION MOMENT = SEARCH FIRST

BEFORE processing ANY user request: search_standards("how to X")
BEFORE implementing: search_standards("how to X")  
BEFORE responding: search_standards("relevant topic")
BEFORE file operations: search_standards("operation protocol")
BEFORE git operations: search_standards("git/commit protocol")
DURING task: search_standards() multiple times
AFTER failures: search_standards("debugging X")

Even "simple" requests have project-specific protocols.
Query first, act second. ALWAYS.

Target: 5-10 queries per task
Query liberally = Reinforces correct behavior = Better code

❌ NEVER: read_file(".praxis-os/standards/...")
❌ NEVER: read_file(".praxis-os/workflows/...")
❌ NEVER: read_file(".praxis-os/usage/...")
✅ ALWAYS: search_standards() for indexed content

✅ DO: read_file(".praxis-os/specs/...") - your specs, not indexed
❌ NEVER: commit without "commit it"

Query liberally = better code
