def discover_mcp_server(
    praxis_os_path: Optional[Path] = None,
) -> Optional[str]:
    """
    Discover a running MCP server's HTTP endpoint by reading its state file.

    This function enables sub-agents to locate and connect to the MCP server
    without hardcoding URLs or ports. It reads the server's state file,
    validates that the server process is still alive, and returns the HTTP URL.

    The discovery process:
    1. Locates the `.praxis-os/.mcp_server_state.json` state file
    2. Reads the server's transport mode, URL, and PID
    3. Validates the PID is still running (checks /proc/{pid} on Unix)
    4. Returns the HTTP URL if server is alive and HTTP-enabled
    5. Returns None if server not found, stale, or stdio-only

    Args:
        praxis_os_path: Path to the .praxis-os directory. If None, searches
                      for .praxis-os in the current directory and parent
                      directories up to the home directory.

    Returns:
        The HTTP URL of the MCP server (e.g., "http://127.0.0.1:4242/mcp"),
        or None if:
        - State file does not exist (server not started)
        - PID is invalid or process not running (stale state)
        - Transport mode is "stdio" (HTTP not enabled)
        - State file is corrupted or missing required fields

    Example:
        >>> from mcp_server.sub_agents import discover_mcp_server
        >>> import requests
        >>>
        >>> # Discover server
        >>> url = discover_mcp_server()
        >>> if url is None:
        ...     print("MCP server not running")
        ... else:
        ...     # Use the URL to make requests
        ...     response = requests.post(
        ...         url,
        ...         json={
        ...             "jsonrpc": "2.0",
        ...             "id": 1,
        ...             "method": "tools/list",
        ...             "params": {}
        ...         }
        ...     )
        ...     print(f"Available tools: {response.json()}")

    Raises:
        No exceptions are raised. All errors are logged and result in
        returning None, making this function safe for use in sub-agent
        initialization logic.

    Notes:
        - This function performs I/O (file read, process check) and should
          be called at connection time, not imported/cached
        - On Windows, PID validation uses psutil if available, otherwise
          assumes PID is valid
        - Thread-safe: reads are atomic, state file is not modified
        - If server crashes without cleanup, stale state will be detected
          via PID check within a few seconds
