# Agent OS Feature Development Process

**The three-phase development process for building features in prAxIs OS: Conversational Design ‚Üí Structured Spec ‚Üí Structured Implementation.**

---

## üö® Quick Reference (TL;DR)

**User wants you to build something - what do you do?** When user says "build authentication" or "create payment system" or wants you to implement any feature, you follow three phases. Don't start coding immediately. Start with discussion, then create spec, then implement.

**Keywords for search**: build-something, user-wants-feature, start-coding-immediately, discussion-first, development-approach

**User says "build X" - where do you start? Three phases:**

**Phase 1: DISCUSS FIRST** (Don't start coding yet!)
- User says "build X" ‚Üí You start with discussion (not coding, not workflows)
- Ask questions about what they want: "Do you need...?" "Should it...?"
- Explore approaches: "We could do A or B, here are trade-offs"
- Don't create spec yet - just discuss and understand
- Output: design-doc.md (captures what you discussed)

**Phase 2: CREATE SPEC** (User must trigger this)
- User says "create the spec" ‚Üí Now you make formal spec
- Query: `search_standards("how to create specification")` to find workflow
- Use workflow to create detailed spec
- User reviews spec before you do anything else
- Output: `.agent-os/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-name/` (formal plan)

**Phase 3: BUILD IT** (User must approve first)
- User says "implement the spec" ‚Üí Now you write code
- Query: `search_standards("how to execute specification")` to find workflow
- Use workflow to implement systematically
- Build code + tests + docs
- Output: Production code (ready to ship)

**Critical - when user wants you to build something:**
- ‚ùå Don't start coding immediately when user says "build X"
- ‚ùå Don't skip straight to spec - discuss first
- ‚ùå Don't auto-advance - wait for user to say "go to next phase"
- ‚úÖ Start with discussion to understand what they really want
- ‚úÖ Query to discover workflows (don't assume you know which workflow to use)

## üéØ Purpose

Define the systematic three-phase development process that transforms user requirements into production-ready code through prAxIs OS. This process ensures quality through structured workflows while maintaining conversational flexibility in early design stages.

**Key Distinction:** The three phases use different modes (conversational vs workflow-driven) and have explicit transition points requiring human approval.

## Why This Matters - What Goes Wrong

**What happens when you start coding immediately:**

**Wrong approach (starting coding immediately):**
```
User: "Build authentication with JWT"
You: [Start coding immediately - no discussion]
30 minutes later...
User: "I meant OAuth, not JWT"
You: [Wasted 30 minutes, have to rewrite everything]
```

**Right approach (discuss first):**
```
User: "Build authentication with JWT"  
You: [Don't start coding - ask questions first]
You: "Do you need social auth? Refresh tokens? MFA?"
User: "Oh yes, Google OAuth and MFA"
You: [Now you understand what they really want]
You: [Create spec, get approval, then build it right the first time]
```

**What goes wrong when you don't follow this:**
- ‚ùå Start coding immediately ‚Üí Build wrong thing, waste time
- ‚ùå Skip discussion ‚Üí Misunderstand what user wants
- ‚ùå Skip spec ‚Üí Miss requirements, have to redo work
- ‚ùå Don't know when to discuss vs when to use workflow ‚Üí Wrong approach
- ‚ùå Auto-advance without approval ‚Üí User loses control
- ‚ùå Assume you know the workflow ‚Üí Use wrong or outdated workflow

## What Is the Three-Phase Development Process?

### Phase 1: Conversational Design Discussion

**When to use:** When user says "build authentication" or "create payment system" or "we need feature X" - this is your starting point for building any feature.

**Mode:** Conversational approach (NOT workflows) - have a design discussion to understand requirements before creating any spec.

**What to do when user says "build X":**

1. **Query for domain knowledge to inform design discussion:**
   ```python
   search_standards("how to [domain] best practices")
   search_standards("[technology] patterns")
   ```

2. **Ask clarifying questions in conversational design discussion:**
   - "Will this be for web, mobile, or both?"
   - "Do you have existing systems to integrate with?"
   - "What are the scale requirements?"
   - "Any compliance needs (GDPR, HIPAA)?"

3. **Propose approaches discovered from standards:**
   - "I found patterns for X using approach A or B"
   - "Approach A is simpler, Approach B scales better"
   - "What's your preference?"

4. **Document the design discussion:**
   - Create `design-doc.md` capturing the conversational exploration
   - Capture architecture decisions from discussion
   - Note trade-offs discussed
   - Include diagrams/examples

5. **Wait for user to trigger next phase:**
   - User says: "Create the spec" or
   - User says: "This design looks good, spec it"
   - **Do NOT auto-advance** - wait for explicit approval

**Critical:** Use conversational mode vs workflows in this phase. Design discussion needs flexibility that workflows don't provide.

**Output:** `design-doc.md` (informal design discussion capture)

**Duration:** 5-30 minutes typically

---

### Phase 2: Structured Spec Creation

**Trigger:** After design discussion, user says "Create the spec" OR "This design looks good, spec it"

**Mode:** Structured workflow-driven (NOT conversational anymore)

**How to move from design discussion to formal spec:**

1. **Query to discover how to create specification:**
   ```python
   search_standards("how to create specification")
   ```
   
   **Critical:** Do NOT hardcode workflow names in your development process - always query to discover current workflows

2. **Use discovered workflow for building the spec:**
   - Follow workflow's systematic guidance
   - Phase-gated execution ensures quality
   - Complete checkpoints at each phase
   - Provide evidence requirements

3. **Create formal specification for building the feature:**
   - README.md (executive summary of what to build)
   - srd.md (business requirements)
   - specs.md (technical design for implementation)
   - tasks.md (breakdown of work from requirements to code)
   - implementation.md (detailed guidance for developers)

4. **Present spec for approval before implementation:**
   - User reviews specification files
   - User requests changes to requirements or design
   - You iterate based on feedback

5. **Wait for approval to advance to implementation:**
   - User says: "Approved" or "Implement the spec"
   - User may request team review first
   - **Do NOT start implementation without approval**

**This phase uses workflows vs conversational approach** - You need structure for systematic spec creation

**Output:** `.agent-os/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name/` directory

**Duration:** 30 minutes - 2 hours typically

---

### Phase 3: Structured Implementation

**Trigger:** After spec approval, user says "Implement the spec" OR "Approved, build it"

**Mode:** Structured workflow-driven (systematic implementation from requirements to code)

**How to go from spec to production code:**

1. **Query to discover how to implement from spec:**
   ```python
   search_standards("how to execute specification")
   ```
   
   **Critical:** Always query for implementation workflow in your development process - don't hardcode workflow names

2. **Use discovered workflow to build from requirements to code:**
   - Parse specification files (requirements, design, tasks)
   - Phase-gated implementation ensures systematic execution
   - Quality validation at each phase
   - Systematic test creation alongside code

3. **Implement feature systematically going from requirements to code:**
   - Phase 0: Review spec and setup structure
   - Phase 1: Core implementation of feature
   - Phase 2: Tests (unit, integration, e2e) 
   - Phase 3: Documentation for the feature
   - Phase 4: Quality validation (tests passing, linter clean)

4. **Present complete implementation of the feature:**
   - Production code implementing all requirements
   - Comprehensive tests validating behavior
   - Documentation explaining how to use the feature
   - All tests passing, linter clean

**This phase uses workflows for systematic building** - Structure ensures going from requirements to production code reliably

**Output:** Production code + tests + documentation (complete feature ready to ship)

**Duration:** 2-8 hours typically (depends on feature scope)

---

## What Are Phase Boundaries (CRITICAL)?

**You CANNOT:**
- ‚ùå Skip Phase 1 (design discussion) ‚Üí Leads to misunderstanding requirements
- ‚ùå Skip Phase 2 (spec creation) ‚Üí Leads to implementation errors and missed requirements
- ‚ùå Auto-advance phases without human trigger ‚Üí Human approval required

**Each phase ends with explicit human trigger for next phase:**

```
Phase 1 ends when user says:
‚Üí "Create the spec" or "This design looks good, spec it"

Phase 2 ends when user says:
‚Üí "Implement the spec" or "Approved, build it"

Phase 3 ends when:
‚Üí Implementation complete, tests passing, presented to user
```

**Why boundaries matter:**
- Design discussion ensures understanding before formalization
- Spec approval ensures agreement before implementation
- Implementation approval ensures quality before shipping

## üö´ Anti-Patterns

### Anti-Pattern 1: Skipping Design Phase

**Wrong:**
```
User: "Build authentication"
Agent: [Immediately creates spec or starts coding]
```

**Why it fails:**
- Misses requirements clarification
- No exploration of approaches
- User expectations not understood

**Right:**
```
User: "Build authentication"
Agent: [Asks clarifying questions]
Agent: [Explores design through conversation]
Agent: [Creates design-doc.md]
Agent: [Waits for "create spec" trigger]
```

---

### Anti-Pattern 2: Hardcoding Workflow Names

**Wrong:**
```python
if user_says_create_spec:
    start_workflow("spec_creation_v1", ...)
```

**Why it fails:**
- Breaks when v2 is released
- Can't discover better workflows
- Defeats discovery architecture

**Right:**
```python
# Discover current workflow
search_standards("how to create specification")
# Returns current best practice (might be v2, v3, different workflow)
# Use whatever is discovered
```

---

### Anti-Pattern 3: Auto-Advancing Phases

**Wrong:**
```
Phase 1 complete ‚Üí Agent auto-creates spec
Phase 2 complete ‚Üí Agent auto-implements
```

**Why it fails:**
- No human approval gates
- User loses control
- Can't review before commitment

**Right:**
```
Phase 1 complete ‚Üí Wait for "create spec" trigger
Phase 2 complete ‚Üí Wait for "implement" trigger
```

---

### Anti-Pattern 4: Using Workflows in Phase 1

**Wrong:**
```
User: "Build authentication"
Agent: start_workflow("design_workflow", ...)
```

**Why it fails:**
- Design needs conversational flexibility
- Workflows are too rigid for exploration
- Premature structure

**Right:**
```
User: "Build authentication"  
Agent: [Pure conversation with queries for patterns]
```

## üîó Related Standards

**Query workflow for building features:**

1. **Start with development process** ‚Üí `search_standards("Agent OS development process")` (this document)
2. **Learn about spec creation** ‚Üí `search_standards("how to create specification")`
3. **Learn about spec execution** ‚Üí `search_standards("how to execute specification")`
4. **Understand operating model** ‚Üí `search_standards("Agent OS operating model human AI partnership")`

**By Phase:**

**Phase 1 (Design):**
- Query: `search_standards("[domain] architecture patterns")`
- Query: `search_standards("[technology] best practices")`

**Phase 2 (Spec):**
- Query: `search_standards("how to create specification")`
- Query: `search_standards("spec structure requirements")`

**Phase 3 (Implementation):**
- Query: `search_standards("how to execute specification")`
- Query: `search_standards("production code quality standards")`

---

**Remember**: Three distinct phases with explicit transitions. Query to discover workflows, don't hardcode. Human approval required between phases. This process ensures quality through systematic execution while maintaining conversational flexibility where needed.
