# Pre-Generation Validation Protocols

**Universal standard for validating context before generating code or making changes**

---

## üéØ TL;DR - Pre-Generation Validation Quick Reference

**Keywords for search**: pre-generation validation, validation checkpoints, pre-task validation, context validation, clean state, import verification, date validation, branch validation, validation before code generation

**Core Principle:** Validate context before each code generation to ensure current, accurate understanding of the codebase.

**Three Validation Checkpoints:**
1. **Pre-Task Validation** (once per user request) - Establish safe starting point, clean state PREFERRED
2. **Pre-Generation Validation** (before each file) - Verify current understanding, clean state NOT required
3. **Pre-Commit Validation** (once before commit) - Ensure quality and completeness

**Pre-Generation Validation Checklist (MANDATORY before each file):**
- [ ] Verify imports exist (never hallucinate imports)
- [ ] Check current date (use `current_date` tool, never hardcode)
- [ ] Verify working branch (use `git branch` if relevant)
- [ ] Confirm file locations (never assume paths)
- [ ] Review recent changes (check if file recently modified)

**Common Validation Mistakes:**
- ‚ùå Using outdated class/module names
- ‚ùå Hallucinating import paths
- ‚ùå Hardcoding dates
- ‚ùå Working on wrong branch
- ‚ùå Skipping per-file validation in multi-file tasks

**Validation Workflow:**
```
User Request ‚Üí Pre-Task Validation (once, clean state preferred)
  ‚Üí Generate File 1 ‚Üí Pre-Generation Validation
  ‚Üí Generate File 2 ‚Üí Pre-Generation Validation
  ‚Üí All Changes Complete ‚Üí Pre-Commit Validation
```

**When to Query This Standard:**
- Before generating code ‚Üí `search_standards("pre-generation validation")`
- Import verification ‚Üí `search_standards("import verification")`
- Date handling ‚Üí `search_standards("date usage policy")`

## üìã Overview

### What is Pre-Generation Validation?

**Pre-generation validation** is the systematic process of ensuring AI has current, accurate understanding of the codebase before generating code or making changes.

### Why It Matters

Without pre-generation validation, AI may:
- ‚ùå Use outdated class/module names
- ‚ùå Use incorrect import paths
- ‚ùå Work on wrong branch
- ‚ùå Use hardcoded dates
- ‚ùå Base decisions on stale assumptions

With pre-generation validation, AI:
- ‚úÖ Uses current code structure
- ‚úÖ Follows correct import conventions
- ‚úÖ Works on intended branch
- ‚úÖ Uses current date
- ‚úÖ Makes informed decisions

---

## What Are the Three Validation Checkpoints?

**CRITICAL**: There are THREE distinct validation moments, each with different requirements.

```
User Request ‚Üí AI Work ‚Üí Commit
     ‚Üì           ‚Üì         ‚Üì
  Pre-Task   Pre-Gen   Pre-Commit
   (Once)   (Per File)  (Once)
```

### Checkpoint 1: Pre-Task Validation
- **When**: Once at the start of each user request
- **Purpose**: Establish safe, known starting point
- **Clean State**: ‚úÖ PREFERRED (warn if not, proceed if user approves)

### Checkpoint 2: Pre-Generation Validation
- **When**: Before generating EACH file or code change
- **Purpose**: Ensure current understanding before each generation
- **Clean State**: ‚ùå NOT REQUIRED (would block multi-file generation!)

### Checkpoint 3: Pre-Commit Validation
- **When**: Once before committing all changes
- **Purpose**: Ensure quality and completeness
- **Clean State**: N/A (state will be dirty, about to commit)

---

## What Is Checkpoint 1: Pre-Task Validation?

**Run ONCE at the start of each user request.**

### Purpose

Establish a safe, known starting point for the task. Verify environment is correct, date is current, and starting state is understood.

### Validation Steps

```bash
# 1. Get current date (prevents hardcoded dates)
CURRENT_DATE=$(date +"%Y-%m-%d")
echo "Today is: $CURRENT_DATE"

# Store for use throughout task - don't re-run this for each file

# 2. Verify correct branch
git branch --show-current

# Expected: feature branch, not main/master (unless working on main)

# 3. Check starting state
git status --porcelain

# If clean: ‚úÖ Good - safe starting point
# If not clean: ‚ö†Ô∏è Warn user, ask if they want to proceed
#   - May be unfinished work from previous task
#   - May be intentional (user wants to add to uncommitted work)
#   - User decides whether to proceed or clean up first

# 4. Verify development environment
[verify_dev_environment_active]
[verify_language_version]

# Examples by language:
# Python: which python && python --version
# JavaScript: which node && node --version
# Go: which go && go version
# Rust: which rustc && rustc --version

# 5. Review recent history (for awareness)
git log --oneline -5

# Purpose: Understand recent project activity
```

### Checklist

- [ ] **Current date**: Retrieved and stored in variable
- [ ] **Correct branch**: Verified and confirmed
- [ ] **Starting state**: Checked (warn if not clean, proceed if user approves)
- [ ] **Development environment**: Active and verified
- [ ] **Language/runtime version**: Confirmed
- [ ] **Recent history**: Reviewed last 5 commits
- [ ] **User intent**: Understand full scope of request

### Clean State Requirement

‚úÖ **PREFERRED** but not strictly required

**If starting state is NOT clean**:
1. Warn user: "Current state has uncommitted changes: [list files]"
2. Ask: "Do you want to proceed or clean up first?"
3. If user approves: Proceed with task
4. If user wants cleanup: Wait for user to clean up

**Why not strictly required**: User may intentionally have uncommitted work they want to add to.

---

## What Is Checkpoint 2: Pre-Generation Validation?

**Run BEFORE generating EACH file or code change.**

### Purpose

Ensure current understanding of codebase before each generation. Be AWARE of project state without BLOCKING on it.

### CRITICAL: Multi-File Task Support

**This validation provides AWARENESS, not BLOCKING.**

Multi-file tasks require uncommitted changes after the first file. If we required clean state here, AI could only generate ONE file per task!

**Example Problem** (if we required clean state):
```bash
Task: "Create module with 3 files"

Generate file 1: ‚úÖ State clean, proceed
# After file 1: State dirty (file 1 uncommitted)

Generate file 2: ‚ùå State not clean, BLOCKED! 
# Can't generate file 2!

Result: Only 1 file generated, task incomplete
```

**Correct Behavior**:
```bash
Task: "Create module with 3 files"

Generate file 1: ‚úÖ State clean, proceed
# After file 1: State dirty - AWARE but not blocking

Generate file 2: ‚úÖ State dirty (file 1), AWARE, proceed  
# After file 2: State dirty - AWARE but not blocking

Generate file 3: ‚úÖ State dirty (files 1-2), AWARE, proceed

Result: All 3 files generated successfully
```

### Validation Steps

```bash
# 1. Use current date from pre-task variable
# $CURRENT_DATE already set in pre-task validation
# Don't re-run date command for each file

# 2. Verify current codebase understanding
read_file [entry_point_file]              # Check current API structure
[search] "[class_pattern]" [source_dir]   # Verify current class names
[search] "[import_pattern]" [examples_dir] # Check import conventions
[search] "[type_pattern]" [source_dir]    # Verify type usage patterns

# Examples by language:
# Python: 
#   read_file src/project/__init__.py
#   grep -r "^class " src/
#   grep -r "^from .* import" src/
#
# JavaScript:
#   read_file src/index.js
#   grep -r "^export class" src/
#   grep -r "^import.*from" src/
#
# Go:
#   read_file main.go
#   grep -r "^type.*struct" .
#   grep -r "^func" .

# 3. State awareness (NOT blocking!)
git status --porcelain

# Purpose: Know what's uncommitted, understand task progress
# NOT REQUIRED: Clean state (would block multi-file generation)
# 
# Interpretation:
# - If clean: First file in task
# - If dirty: Subsequent files in multi-file task (expected!)
# - Understand what's part of current task vs pre-existing

# 4. Verify still on correct branch
git branch --show-current

# Purpose: Prevent accidental branch switch during task
# This CAN block - if branch changed, something is wrong
```

### Checklist

- [ ] **API structure**: Current understanding verified
- [ ] **Class/module names**: Confirmed current names
- [ ] **Import patterns**: Verified correct conventions  
- [ ] **Type patterns**: Confirmed current usage
- [ ] **State awareness**: Know what's uncommitted (NOT blocking)
- [ ] **Correct branch**: Still on intended branch (this IS blocking)
- [ ] **Task context**: Understand what's already generated in this task

### Clean State Requirement

‚ùå **NOT REQUIRED** - Would block multi-file generation

**Key Principle**: Be AWARE of state, don't BLOCK on state

---

## What Is Checkpoint 3: Pre-Commit Validation?

**Run ONCE before committing all changes.**

### Purpose

Ensure all changes meet quality standards before committing. This is where we verify quality, not state cleanliness (state WILL be dirty at this point).

### Validation Steps

```bash
# 1. Verify committing from correct branch
git branch --show-current

# Should still be on the intended branch

# 2. Review what's being committed
git status --porcelain

# See all uncommitted changes that will be part of commit
# Expected: Multiple files if multi-file task

# 3. Run quality gates (ALL must pass)
[format_command]              # Code formatting
[lint_command]                # Static analysis
[type_check_command]          # Type checking
[unit_test_command]           # Unit tests
[integration_test_command]    # Integration tests (if applicable)

# Examples by language:
# Python:
#   tox -e format    # Black + isort
#   tox -e lint      # Pylint + mypy
#   tox -e unit      # pytest unit tests
#
# JavaScript:
#   npm run format   # Prettier
#   npm run lint     # ESLint
#   npm test         # Jest
#
# Go:
#   gofmt -l .
#   golint ./...
#   go test ./...
#
# Rust:
#   cargo fmt --check
#   cargo clippy
#   cargo test

# 4. Verify documentation (if applicable)
[doc_build_command]           # Documentation builds without warnings

# Examples:
# Python: cd docs && make html
# JavaScript: npm run docs
# Rust: cargo doc --no-deps
```

### Checklist

- [ ] **Correct branch**: Verified
- [ ] **Changes reviewed**: Appropriate scope
- [ ] **Formatting**: 100% compliant
- [ ] **Static analysis**: Meets project threshold
- [ ] **Type checking**: Zero errors (if project requires)
- [ ] **Unit tests**: 100% pass
- [ ] **Integration tests**: 100% pass (if applicable)
- [ ] **Documentation**: Builds successfully (if applicable)
- [ ] **User review**: Requested and received

### Clean State Requirement

N/A - State WILL be dirty (that's what we're committing)

---

## What Is Context-Specific Validation?

**Additional validation for specific contexts.**

### For Test Fixing Tasks

**Additional validation before fixing tests**:

```bash
# Understand production code before fixing tests

# 1. Read the production module being tested
read_file [production_module]

# 2. Search for method/class being tested
[search] "def method_name" [source_dir]
[search] "class ClassName" [source_dir]

# 3. Check method signatures
[search] -A10 "def method_name" [production_file]

# Purpose: Understand current implementation before fixing test
# Tests fail because they don't match production - need to know production
```

**Why This Matters**:

```python
# Test fails: ImportError: cannot import name 'OldClass'
# Without validation: AI guesses the import path, tries multiple times
# With validation: AI searches for class, finds it moved to new location, fixes import immediately
```

---

### For API Changes

**Additional validation before changing APIs**:

```bash
# Check current API consumers before making changes

# 1. Find all imports of the API
[search] "from module import" [examples_dir]
[search] "from module import" [test_dir]
[search] "import module" [source_dir]

# 2. Find all usages of the API
[search] "module\.function" [source_dir]
[search] "Class\(" [source_dir]

# Purpose: Understand impact of changes
# Helps identify breaking changes before making them
```

**Why This Matters**:

```python
# Changing function signature
# Without validation: AI changes function, breaks 10 call sites
# With validation: AI sees 10 call sites, updates them all in same commit
```

---

### For Configuration Changes

**Additional validation before changing configuration**:

```bash
# Check configuration usage patterns

# 1. Find how configuration is accessed
[search] "config\." [source_dir]
[search] "Config\(" [source_dir]

# 2. Find configuration creation
[search] "load_config" [source_dir]
[search] "create_config" [source_dir]

# Purpose: Ensure consistency in configuration usage
```

---

## Example: How Does Validation Work in Multi-File Tasks?

**Scenario**: User says "Create tracer module with implementation, config, and tests (3 files)"

### Pre-Task Validation (Once at Start)

```bash
# ============================================================
# PRE-TASK VALIDATION (Run ONCE at start of user request)
# ============================================================

CURRENT_DATE=$(date +"%Y-%m-%d")
echo "Today is: $CURRENT_DATE"
# Output: Today is: 2025-10-09

git branch --show-current
# Output: feature/new-tracer

git status --porcelain
# Output: (empty - clean)
# ‚úÖ Clean starting point

which python && python --version
# Output: /path/to/venv/bin/python
#         Python 3.11.0
# ‚úÖ Environment verified

git log --oneline -5
# Output: Recent commits for context
# ‚úÖ Aware of recent changes

# PRE-TASK VALIDATION COMPLETE ‚úÖ
# Safe to proceed with task
```

---

### Generate File 1: src/tracer.py

```bash
# ============================================================
# PRE-GENERATION VALIDATION (Before file 1)
# ============================================================

# Use current date from pre-task (already set)
# $CURRENT_DATE = 2025-10-09

# Verify current codebase understanding
read_file src/__init__.py
# Check current API exports to understand structure
# ‚úÖ Current understanding verified

grep -r "^class " src/
# Verify current class names and patterns
# ‚úÖ Naming conventions understood

# State awareness (NOT blocking)
git status --porcelain
# Output: (empty - clean)
# ‚úÖ AWARE: First file in task, state clean

# Verify still on correct branch
git branch --show-current
# Output: feature/new-tracer
# ‚úÖ Still on correct branch

# PRE-GENERATION VALIDATION COMPLETE ‚úÖ
# Safe to generate file 1

# GENERATE: src/tracer.py
[AI writes src/tracer.py with Tracer class implementation]
```

---

### Generate File 2: src/tracer_config.py

```bash
# ============================================================
# PRE-GENERATION VALIDATION (Before file 2)
# ============================================================

# State awareness (NOT blocking)
git status --porcelain
# Output: ?? src/tracer.py
# ‚úÖ AWARE: File 1 uncommitted (expected in multi-file task)
# ‚úÖ NOT BLOCKING: Proceed with file 2
# 
# This is the CRITICAL FIX - we don't block on dirty state!

# Verify still on correct branch
git branch --show-current  
# Output: feature/new-tracer
# ‚úÖ Still on correct branch

# Verify current patterns for config classes
grep -r "class.*Config" src/
# Check how other config classes are structured
# ‚úÖ Pattern understood

# PRE-GENERATION VALIDATION COMPLETE ‚úÖ
# Safe to generate file 2

# GENERATE: src/tracer_config.py
[AI writes src/tracer_config.py with TracerConfig class]
```

---

### Generate File 3: tests/test_tracer.py

```bash
# ============================================================
# PRE-GENERATION VALIDATION (Before file 3)
# ============================================================

# State awareness (NOT blocking)
git status --porcelain
# Output: ?? src/tracer.py
#         ?? src/tracer_config.py
# ‚úÖ AWARE: Files 1-2 uncommitted (expected in multi-file task)
# ‚úÖ NOT BLOCKING: Proceed with file 3

# Read production code to test it correctly
read_file src/tracer.py
# Understand implementation to write appropriate tests
# ‚úÖ Implementation understood

# Check existing test patterns
grep -r "^class Test" tests/
# Verify test naming conventions
# ‚úÖ Test patterns understood

# PRE-GENERATION VALIDATION COMPLETE ‚úÖ
# Safe to generate file 3

# GENERATE: tests/test_tracer.py
[AI writes tests/test_tracer.py with comprehensive tests]
```

---

### Pre-Commit Validation (Once Before Committing All 3 Files)

```bash
# ============================================================
# PRE-COMMIT VALIDATION (Before committing all 3 files)
# ============================================================

# Verify still on correct branch
git branch --show-current
# Output: feature/new-tracer
# ‚úÖ Correct branch

# Review what's being committed
git status --porcelain
# Output: ?? src/tracer.py
#         ?? src/tracer_config.py
#         ?? tests/test_tracer.py
# ‚úÖ All 3 files ready to commit

# Run quality gates (ALL must pass)
tox -e format
# Output: ‚úÖ All 3 files formatted correctly

tox -e lint
# Output: ‚úÖ All 3 files pass linting (Pylint 10.0/10.0)

tox -e type
# Output: ‚úÖ All 3 files pass type checking (MyPy 0 errors)

tox -e unit
# Output: ‚úÖ All tests pass (100%)

# PRE-COMMIT VALIDATION COMPLETE ‚úÖ
# Safe to commit all 3 files

# Present to user for review
"Ready to commit 3 files:
 - src/tracer.py (implementation)
 - src/tracer_config.py (configuration)
 - tests/test_tracer.py (tests)

All quality gates passed. Commit?"

# User approves
git add src/tracer.py src/tracer_config.py tests/test_tracer.py
git commit -m "feat: add tracer module with configuration"

# TASK COMPLETE ‚úÖ
```

## What Are Common Validation Mistakes?

### Mistake 1: Requiring Clean State in Pre-Generation

**‚ùå WRONG**:
```bash
# Pre-generation validation (before each file)
git status --porcelain
if [ -n "$(git status --porcelain)" ]; then
    echo "ERROR: State must be clean"
    exit 1
fi
```

**Why It's Wrong**: Blocks multi-file generation after first file

**‚úÖ CORRECT**:
```bash
# Pre-generation validation (before each file)
git status --porcelain
# Note uncommitted files, understand task context
# Continue regardless of state
```

---

### Mistake 2: Not Validating Current API Structure

**‚ùå WRONG**:
```python
# Assuming class name based on memory
from module import OldClassName  # May have been renamed!
```

**Why It's Wrong**: Uses outdated assumptions

**‚úÖ CORRECT**:
```bash
# Validate current structure
grep -r "class.*ClassName" src/
# Find actual current class name, use that
```

---

### Mistake 3: Re-Running Date Command for Each File

**‚ùå WRONG**:
```bash
# Before each file:
CURRENT_DATE=$(date +"%Y-%m-%d")
```

**Why It's Wrong**: Wasteful, could cause inconsistency if crossing midnight

**‚úÖ CORRECT**:
```bash
# Pre-task: Get date once
CURRENT_DATE=$(date +"%Y-%m-%d")

# Pre-generation: Use stored date
# Use $CURRENT_DATE variable
```

---

## How to Define Project-Specific Validation?

**Projects should define validation commands in `.praxis-os/standards/development/validation-commands.md`.**

### Example Validation Commands File

```markdown
# Project Name - Validation Commands

## Environment Validation

### Python Virtual Environment
```bash
which python
# Expected: /path/to/project/venv/bin/python

python --version
# Expected: Python 3.11+
```

## Codebase Understanding

### API Structure
```bash
read_file src/project/__init__.py
```

### Import Patterns
```bash
grep -r "^from project import" src/
```

## Quality Gates

### Format Check
```bash
tox -e format
# Must pass - zero tolerance
```

### Lint Check
```bash
tox -e lint
# Must pass - Pylint ‚â•8.0, MyPy 0 errors
```

### Test Execution
```bash
tox -e unit
# Must pass 100%
```
```

## How to Teach Validation to New AI Assistants?

### Key Principles

1. **Three checkpoints, three purposes** - Pre-task (safety), pre-generation (understanding), pre-commit (quality)
2. **Clean state at task start, not per-file** - Critical for multi-file tasks
3. **State awareness, not blocking** - Know what's uncommitted, don't block on it
4. **Current date once, use many times** - Don't re-run date command
5. **Validation is fast, rework is slow** - 30-90 seconds validation prevents hours of debugging

---

## ‚ùì FAQ

### Q: Why three validation checkpoints instead of one?

**A**: Each has a different purpose and timing. Pre-task establishes safety, pre-generation ensures understanding, pre-commit verifies quality.

### Q: Why not require clean state before each file?

**A**: It would block multi-file generation. After file 1, state is dirty, so file 2 would be blocked.

### Q: What if I'm not sure if state is clean because of current task or previous work?

**A**: Check git status early in task. If dirty at start, warn user. If becomes dirty during task, that's expected.

### Q: Should I validate before making each small change within a file?

**A**: No. Validate once before generating the file. Making multiple edits within same file doesn't need repeated validation.
