# Workflow Definition Template v1.0
# ============================================================================
#
# PURPOSE:
# This template defines the structure for creating workflow specifications.
# After a design conversation, fill this template to create a complete
# workflow definition that workflow_creation_v1 can consume.
#
# USAGE:
# 1. Search standards for "workflow definition format" to learn the structure
# 2. List universal/templates/ directory to find this template
# 3. Read this complete file
# 4. Fill all REQUIRED sections based on design conversation
# 5. Add OPTIONAL sections as needed
# 6. Validate completeness
# 7. Save as {workflow-name}-definition.yaml
#
# ============================================================================

problem:
  statement: |
    [Multi-paragraph description of the problem this workflow solves.

    Include:
    - What problem exists that requires systematic approach
    - What constraints or requirements must be met
    - What complexity justifies a structured workflow
    - What domain expertise is needed

    Be specific about the context and scope. This should clearly explain
    WHY this workflow exists and WHAT it accomplishes.]

  why_workflow: "[Explain why this needs to be a workflow rather than a tool or standard. Consider: Does it require multiple phases? Does it need validation gates? Does it require systematic execution with quality checkpoints?]"

  success_criteria:
    # REQUIRED: List of measurable outcomes that define success
    # Each criterion should be specific and verifiable
    - "[Measurable criterion 1 - e.g., 'All modules have 95%+ test coverage']"
    - "[Measurable criterion 2 - e.g., 'Zero critical security vulnerabilities']"
    - "[Measurable criterion 3 - e.g., 'Documentation complete for all APIs']"
    # Add as many as needed - typically 3-7 criteria

# ============================================================================
# REQUIRED: Phase Definitions
# ============================================================================

phases:
  # Each workflow must have at least one phase
  # Phases should represent natural boundaries/milestones in the process
  # Each phase produces a concrete deliverable

  - number: 0
    # REQUIRED: Phase number (0-indexed)
    # Convention: Start at 0, increment sequentially

    name: "[Phase Name]"
    # REQUIRED: Human-readable phase name
    # Examples: "Requirements Analysis", "Implementation", "Testing"

    purpose: "[What this phase accomplishes - one clear sentence]"
    # REQUIRED: Clear statement of phase objective

    deliverable: "[Concrete output produced by this phase]"
    # REQUIRED: Tangible result (document, code, tests, etc.)
    # Examples: "Architecture document with diagrams", "Working implementation",
    #           "Complete test suite with 95%+ coverage"

    # REQUIRED: Task definitions
    tasks:
      - number: 1
        # REQUIRED: Task number within phase (1-indexed)

        name: "[kebab-case-task-name]"
        # REQUIRED: Task identifier used for filename: task-{number}-{name}.md
        # Examples: "gather-requirements", "implement-core", "write-tests"
        # Convention: lowercase, hyphen-separated, descriptive

        purpose: "[One-line description of what this task does]"
        # REQUIRED: Clear, concise task objective

        # OPTIONAL: Additional task metadata
        domain_focus: "[Domain expertise area]"
        # Optional: Specify domain knowledge needed
        # Used by workflow_creation_v1 to search for relevant expertise
        # Examples: "Payment Processing", "AST Analysis", "Security"

        estimated_lines: 100
        # Optional: Target line count for task file (default: 100)

        commands_needed:
          # Optional: List of tools/commands this task will use
          # Helps workflow_creation_v1 add appropriate examples
          - "write"
          - "read_file"
          - "grep"
          # Common: write, read_file, grep, run_terminal_cmd, search_standards,
          #         codebase_search, list_dir, glob_file_search

        steps_outline:
          # 🔥 STRONGLY RECOMMENDED: High-level steps for this task
          # WITHOUT THIS: Phase 4 generation will use weak fallback logic
          # WITH THIS: Task files will have rich, actionable 100-170 line instructions
          #
          # Providing detailed steps results in AI-executable task files.
          # Without steps, generated tasks will be generic stubs that agents cannot execute.
          #
          # ✅ GOOD PRACTICE: Break down task into 3-8 logical steps
          # Example: For "validate-structure" task:
          # - "Load YAML definition file"
          # - "Load template schema"
          # - "Validate required fields present"
          # - "Validate data types correct"
          # - "Document validation results"
          #
          # ❌ BAD PRACTICE: Leaving this empty or using single vague step
          - "[Step 1 overview - be specific about action to take]"
          - "[Step 2 overview - include any tool/command needed]"
          - "[Step 3 overview - mention validation/verification]"
          - "[Step 4 overview - document output/result]"

        examples_needed:
          # 🔥 STRONGLY RECOMMENDED: Types of examples to include
          # WITHOUT THIS: Phase 4 may skip examples or use generic placeholders
          # WITH THIS: Task files will include concrete, instructive examples
          #
          # Be specific about example types (success case, failure case, etc.)
          # Examples make task files significantly more useful for AI agents.
          #
          # ✅ GOOD PRACTICE: Specify 2-3 example types per task
          # Example: For "implement-api" task:
          # - "Success case: Valid request returns 200"
          # - "Failure case: Invalid auth returns 401"
          # - "Edge case: Malformed request returns 400"
          #
          # ❌ BAD PRACTICE: Generic "add example here" or leaving empty
          - "[Example type 1 - e.g., 'Success case example with working code']"
          - "[Example type 2 - e.g., 'Failure/edge case example with error handling']"

        validation_criteria:
          # 🔥 STRONGLY RECOMMENDED: Task-specific success criteria
          # WITHOUT THIS: Generic "Task completed successfully" will be used
          # WITH THIS: Task files will have specific, measurable quality checks
          #
          # Make criteria specific and measurable (not vague).
          # These become the Quality Checks section in generated task files.
          #
          # ✅ GOOD PRACTICE: 3-5 specific, measurable criteria per task
          # Example: For "write-tests" task:
          # - "Test coverage >= 95%"
          # - "All edge cases covered"
          # - "Tests pass in CI"
          # - "No skipped tests"
          #
          # ❌ BAD PRACTICE: "Task complete", "Looks good", "Finished"
          - "[Criterion 1 - must be measurable, e.g., 'File size under 170 lines']"
          - "[Criterion 2 - must be specific, e.g., 'All required sections present']"
          - "[Criterion 3 - must be verifiable, e.g., 'No linter errors']"
